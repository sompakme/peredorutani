Well, yellow wavelengths treat redness and increase circulation, and are great for anyone dealing with rosacea.

For a more personalized recommendation or if you have any concerns, check with your board-certified dermatologist.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-an-led-mask><span>What to Look For in an LED Mask</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Efficacy: </strong>Big LED machines in spas and dermatologists' offices are obviously a lot more powerful than little at-home masks. You're going to need a certain level of LED light exposure to see results with your personal tools. "For an LED mask to be effective, it must be at a clinically relevant wavelength, and have a reasonable amount of irradiance or power," explains <a href=# data-url=https://toceyeandface.com/doctors/doctor-tanuj-nakra/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Tanuj Nakra, MD, FACS</a> and co-founder of AVYA Skincare. These numbers should be available through the manufacturer or on the product page—below, we dive into what to look for for each color.</li><li><strong>Types of Colors Offered: </strong>Every color of light corresponds with a specific wavelength that directly correlates with specific results. Red and blue lights typically treat hyperpigmentation, visible signs of aging, and acne. Yellow lights can address redness and rosacea while increasing circulation. For repairing slight skin abrasions, white wavelengths are the best option. Make sure you reference these ranges before you commit to a mask, <a href=# data-url=https://emskinla.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>board-certified esthetician Erica Marie</a> advises. "If the device you’re looking at lists a different nanometer that’s not in range, or mentions a different color, it’s not going to help you achieve your skin goals." She explains that blue light should fall within 445 to 490 nm, green light should fall within 490 to 570 nm, yellow light should fall within 570 to 590 nm, red light should fall within 620 to 780 nm, and white light should fall within 700 to 1000 nm.</li><li><strong>FDA Approval: </strong>While there are dozens and dozens of LED light therapy face masks to choose from, only a handful have FDA approval. "The search for a safe and effective device begins with making sure the device is FDA approved," says Dr. Nakra. You can check this for yourself on the <a href=# data-url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/devicesatfda/index.cfm referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>FDA's database</a>.</li><li><strong>Design: </strong>While you might prefer an LED mask that goes on like a pair of sunglasses, others might want a design that straps them in—it's really personal preference. That said, some features are non-negotiable, like the number of LED lights and their distribution. The more LED lights, Dr. Marie says, the better. "In order for the lights to penetrate directly into the cells, they need to be close together and there needs to be a lot of lights, at least 100 or more," she continues. "You also want the lights as close together as possible to get the best results."</li><li><strong>Comfort: </strong>The most comfortable at-home LED for you largely comes down to personal preference. Because they are heavier devices, chances are they are going to feel a little weighted—it just depends where that weight is distributed. A rubber or silicone option will rub the skin less, a sunglass-inspired mask will likely cause a little ear irritation, and a behind-the-head strap will require you to sit still.</li></ul><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-is-led-therapy-safe><span>Is LED Therapy Safe?</span></h2><p>After years of avoiding the sun's UV rays in the service of healthy skin, treating your face with light can feel counter-intuitive. But facialists, dermatologists, beauty editors, and the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/skin-conditions-lasers-treat referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>American Academy of Dermatology</a> all agree: Generally speaking, LED light therapy treatments are safe and effective, since they don't use UV rays.</p><p>A couple of caveats, however: You should be careful about using LED face masks alongside skincare that makes your face sensitive to light, like <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22777936/what-is-retinol/>retinol</a> or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/accutane-isotretinoin-guide/>Accutane</a>. "Prescription drugs, including antibiotics, diuretics, and even some over-the-counter medications such as St. John’s Wort can cause sensitivity to LED light therapy," explains Dr. Nakra. "Rare eye conditions including certain retinal diseases can be exacerbated by LEDs as well. If you are unsure, check with your doctor or dermatologist about whether your medication can cause light sensitivity (photosensitivity)."</p><p>You'll also want to exercise extra caution when it comes to blue light. "Using it longer than 20 minutes can cause pigmentation to worsen or appear," says Marie.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-benefits-of-led-therapy><span>The Benefits of LED Therapy</span></h2><p>At-home LED therapy devices are less powerful than the treatments you'd get at a dermatologist's office, which means you can use them safely, but it'll take longer to see visible results. The result you'll see, however, depends largely on the type of light therapy you're using. Most of the LED face masks on our list use either red (age-reducing) or blue light therapy (anti-bacterial) to treat several skin woes, but there are also different wavelengths—including white, yellow, amber, and green—that might be featured in your product. "Combining more than one wavelength helps you get the best results," says Marie. "Your skin is always changing, so it’s nice to have options."</p><p>Ahead, find detailed breakdowns of the benefits of the most LED light therapy colors with insight from our experts.</p><ul><li><strong>Benefits of Red LED Light Therapy: </strong><a href=# data-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3926176/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Red light </a>is going to be the most popular color you'll find in LED masks, in part because its benefits are so wide-ranging. "Red LED lights emit energy that travels deep into the skin, and stimulates the molecular pathways inside the cells and mitochondria to produce more collagen, reduce inflammation, and reduce redness," explains Dr. Nakra. “It has also been shown to increase collagen and elastin synthesis and therefore reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles," adds <a href=# data-url=https://dranettareszko.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Anetta Rezsko</a>, a New York City-based dermatologist.</li><li><strong>Benefits of Blue LED Light Therapy: </strong>Unlike red light therapy, <a href=# data-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8307003/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>blue light therapy</a> “has shorter wavelengths and works best for acne-prone skin,” says Dr. Reszko. It reduces the frequency of new breakouts and treats existing ones, courtesy of a two-step process within the layers of your skin. First, she says, blue light “decreases the androgenic hormones in the sebaceous glands." In layman's terms, that means means your skin will produce less oil. Less oil equals less clogged pores. Then comes step two: The destruction of bacteria. "Blue LED lights have a high power to treat bacteria on the skin, specifically P acnes, the bacteria that causes acne," adds Dr. Nakra.</li><li><strong>Benefits of Green LED Light Therapy: </strong>The opposite of red on the color wheel? Green, which is why <a href=# data-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5843358/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>green light therapy</a> is a saving grace for anyone with unwanted redness or rosacea. "Green LED light penetrates into the intermediate layers of the skin and is absorbed preferentially by minute blood vessels that can cause facial redness and rosacea," explains Dr. Nakra. The result? A more even skin tone. Marie adds that green light "targets dark circles and pigmentation" by preventing excess melanin from being produced.</li><li><strong>Benefits of Yellow LED Light Therapy: </strong>The benefits of <a href=# data-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4479368/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>yellow light</a> are somewhat similar to those of green light. While you typically won't find a device with exclusively yellow light therapy, it may be one of your options. "Yellow LED light penetrates into the superficial layers of the skin," explains Dr. Nakra. Marie adds that by doing this, it's able to stimulate blood flow and reduce redness, rosacea, and the appearance of broken capillaries.
