While he doesn't fully resemble the beloved BSAA agent, we can at least tell who he's playing. His outfits, however, are far from what Chris Redfield wore in the video games. Instead of short sleeves with BSAA patches on them, he wears some kind of tactical field jacket. He's got plenty of gear strapped onto his torso, but his all-grey ensemble just makes him look like a failed Ghostbuster, or an overzealous maintenance man. But that's all we'll say about that subject, lest we find ourselves on the receiving end of those guns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FlHJpb2eTlsC1edGeqqKclaPBbrHVoqNmqpWWua3FjKWmqKNf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tina-turner-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Tina Turner Net Worth 2024</span></a>
