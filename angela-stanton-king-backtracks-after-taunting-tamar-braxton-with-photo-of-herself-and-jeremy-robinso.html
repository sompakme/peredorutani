Overall, she is currently working on Robert F. Kennedy Jr's Presidential campaign, which is likely going to lose in staggering fashion. After all, he is an independent candidate. It is rare for an independent to make headway, especially with most voters focused on the rematch between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for Stanton-King, last night, she shifted her attention to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tamar Braxton</a>. The two have been in a bit of a feud as of late, with Braxton telling Stanton-King's son that he doesn't need her. Well, Stanton-King subsequently sought revenge as she posted a picture of herself with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Braxton's on-again off-again beau, Jeremy Robinson.</a> In the Instagram caption, Stanton-King noted that she told Robinson to his face that he didn't Braxton, and that Robinson agreed with the sentiment.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-angela-stanton-king-says-she-doesn-t-want-j-r>Angela Stanton-King Says She Doesn't Want J.R.</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This began to blow up on social media, with many calling Stanton-King "messy" for her comments. However, she eventually came back and clarified some things. Mainly, she noted how she had no interest in Jeremy Robinson as she only wants to date black men. "My preference is and has always been dark chocolate," she said matter-of-factly. Despite the clarification, fans still felt like Stanton-King was out of pocket for her comments. Moreover, fans saw it as a total clout move that will forever be considered corny.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about all of this drama, in the comments section down below.
