The couple first developed the concept ahead of the birth of their first son, Milan, with the hope of helping babies and mothers who need it most. Their <a class=hm-link href=#>first Virtual Baby Shower in 2013</a> was a huge success; <strong>over 80,000 children were vaccinated against</strong> polio, nearly four tons of therapeutic food helped children suffering from malnutrition, plus around 1,000 anti-malaria bed nets and nearly 200,000 oral rehydration salts sachets were distributed. Now UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Shakira is hoping for more generosity from fans ahead of the birth of her second child. "Now that we are soon welcoming our second child<strong> we want to help other children around the world</strong> and also contribute to a long-lasting solution for getting children living in extreme poverty the supplies they need to survive," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34a9ee1d9f07-shakira-ballon-a.jpg><p id=etjmWPRuH8rz data-wc=9><strong>Shakira already has a son, Milan, with footballer Gerard</strong></p><p id=evl8yk4DyVQb data-wc=62>Fans of the expectant couple are invited to participate in the event by buying 'Inspired Gifts' online, including measles and polio vaccines, blankets and midwifery kits, which will directly benefit UNICEF's work.

If every expectant mother having a baby shower decided to include among her gift registry some of these 'inspired gifts' that UNICEF offers, <strong>we could collectively save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children all over the globe</strong>," she wrote.
