There are now multiple ways to make that happen, all with minimal effort. But if you're trying to decide between brow lamination versus microblading, it can be hard to discern the key differences between the two.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While both treatments have the same end goal of denser, thicker brows, they involve complete different procedures — which is why it's key to understand the nuances between them. After all, brows have the power to define and shape the face, so a bad brow job is best avoided. With that in mind, we asked experts to share everything you need to know about brow lamination and microblading.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-brow-lamination></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Brow Lamination</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What Is Brow Lamination?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brow lamination is a chemical treatment that straightens brow hairs; the goal is to get hair to lie very flat and straight by removing any curls, kinks, or other texture that your natural brow may have. "With&nbsp;lamination, a perming solution that contains, in most cases, an active ingredient called ammonium thioglycolate, which is applied to the&nbsp;brow&nbsp;hairs to temporarily relax and straighten them," says celebrity brow artist and eponymous brand founder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Joey Healy</a>. "Next, a neutralizing solution is applied to fix the&nbsp;brow&nbsp;hairs into an upright position, making them appear fuller and darker."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a result, brow lamination can deliver fuller-looking brows that can visually open up the eye area. It's also low maintenance once your brows are shaped, and tends to be relatively more affordable than microblading. (Healy says that you can expect to spend anywhere between $100 and $200, although exact costs will depend on who you see and where you live.)</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How Brow Lamination Works</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lamination is a two-step application process: A solution is first applied to break down hair bonds, followed by a neutralizing agent to keep them straight and flat. This treatment should not hurt — and if you feel any burning or pain, you may have sensitivity to the chemicals used. To avoid this, Healy recommends asking your brow artist to do a patch test before moving forward with the treatment.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Side Effects of Brow Lamination</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For starters, the chemicals used in brow lamination could results in allergic reactions or, in severe cases, infection, says Healy. It can also be very damaging to your hair if you get it too often. "It's very drying — and causes brows to have that chemical-treated feeling," he says. So you may only want to spring for this once in a while to avoid stripping your brows and making them brittle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another downside is that you can't undo it. In other words: If you don't like how one-dimensional brow lamination can look, "you’re going to have to just wait until it softens up on its own," Healy says.&nbsp;Brow lamination can last for a month, but it can sometimes be longer or shorter depending on the person.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-microblading></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Microblading</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What Is Microblading?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Microblading is, at its core, a semi-permanent tattoo. Using a tiny blade filled with pigment, an artist makes small cuts in sparse areas in the brow area. These ultimately "imitate the length, color, thickness, and shape of the actual hairs," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Kristyn&nbsp;Smith</a>, Practise founder and celebrity esthetician. "Special pigments in the color of the natural hairs are then deposited into the skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This treatment has many benefits, Smith says: Because it's semi-permanent, it is waterproof and therefore won't run or smudge. It's also customizable to suit your face shape and your needs. You'll only need a yearly touch-up, so it's perfect for anyone looking for low maintenance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That said, those perks come at a cost. You can expect to pay anywhere from $500 to over $1000, depending on who you see and your location. (FYI: Since it's a more invasive procedure, too, this requires more vetting — ask for referrals and before-and-afters to make sure you get the results you want.)<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How Microblading Works</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Microblading is essentially a tattoo," says Smith. "It creates a full look where there isn't any, or a perfect shape if brows are lacking in hair growth." A trained technician will use a special blade filled with pigment to create tiny cuts in stroke-like motions to fake the appearance of new hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because it's similar to getting a tattoo, the treatment can be painful, especially if your pain tolerance is low. It will take about three to four weeks for skin to completely heal, too, says Healy, so expect some downtime.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Side Effects Of Microblading</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The most common downside of microblading is the awkward fading that can occur, which can give the hairs a reddish or blue tint. Those with oily skin don't hold pigment as long as other skin types, so they may experience fading sooner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The good news? You can go six to eight months before needing a touch-up, Healy says. Going in earlier or on a more constant basis may end up making your brows look too muddy.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-between-them></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How To Choose Between Them</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is all dependent on your needs. Brow lamination would be a great option for someone who already has ample brow growth but looking for more shape and definition, Smith says. And, if you have unruly hair that won't hold with brow gel or just looking to get that soap-brow effect, brow lamination is definitely the route you should go — keeping in mind that "you should have thick, strong brow hairs if you’re going to do lamination, because the process can potentially strip the hair and be damaging," Healy says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Microblading, on the other hand, is ideal for anyone who has thin brows and looking to fake the appearance of full brows. So if you're looking for the appearance of full, bushy brow, this might be the treatment for you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waumsGWclrqqusCtoKimXavAbrnInKmompyWsaq6xmZubmhjZoR1</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./backstairs-billy-leaves-treasured-paintings-to-prince-charles.html><span>←</span><span>Backstairs Billy leaves treasured paintings to Prince Charles</span></a>
