Ohtani considers sleep as an essential part of his training, especially during the grueling <a href=# rel=nofollow>162-game</a><strong>MLB</strong> season.</p><p>And thanks to his partnership with Nishikawa, <a href=#>Ohtani</a> has access to a wide range of innovative products that further encourage deep sleep. One such product is a <a href=# rel=nofollow>portable mattress</a> he first used during the <strong>World Baseball Classic</strong>.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>The emergence of sleep science</h2><p><strong>Ohtani</strong> is a prime example of how beneficial regular, lengthy sleep can be relative to peak athletic performance.</p><p>Several <strong>NFL</strong> teams began seriously <a href=# rel=nofollow>embracing</a> sleep science in the mid-2010s. The emerging field was also credited with helping <strong>Premier League</strong> side <strong>Leicester City</strong> overcome 5000-to-1 odds to win the title in 2016 -- and now it's been revealed that consistent, prolonged sleep is critical for Ohtani's amazing achievements as a hitter and a pitcher.</p><p>As usual, Ohtani will be one of the top players to watch now that the <strong>All-Star Game</strong> is finished. The 29-year-old could be playing out his final months with the <strong>Angels</strong>, with <strong>Los Angeles</strong> set to miss the postseason again as the two-way phenomenon's contract expires this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqajm2ecpMBurc2gnKWdo2Kur7PEpapoamBngHB8lmhoa2dmaa6mfcOdam1uYWuAp3yUbG5xmmRqhKN6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pusha-t-exposes-drake-for-allegedly-having-a-son-with-porn-star-on-new-diss-track.html><span>←</span><span>Pusha T Exposes Drake For Allegedly Having A Son With Porn Star On New Diss Track</span></a>
