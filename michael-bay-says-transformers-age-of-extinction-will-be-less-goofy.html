Director Michael Bay has built an empire around the Transformers film series. While audiences and critics universally pan the Transformers movies, the series is one of Paramount Pictures’ most profitable ones. Whether it has to do with nostalgia or Michael Bay’s penchant for loud explosions and action, the new film in the series, Transformers: Age of Extinction, will most likely be another big moneymaker for Paramount and Hasbro."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

While audiences and critics universally pan the Transformers movies, the series is one of Paramount Pictures’ most profitable ones. Whether it has to do with nostalgia or Michael Bay’s penchant for loud explosions and action, the new film in the series, <a href=#>Transformers: Age of Extinction</a>, will most likely be another big moneymaker for Paramount and Hasbro. And according to Bay, the new film will be less goofy than the ones that preceded it.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>Yahoo!</a>, the 48-year-old director opened up about Age of Extinction‘s tone. Apparently, Bay wanted <a href=#>Transformers 4</a> to feel more cinematic and slick than the first Transformers film trilogy. While the film is not a reboot, it will look and feel different than the Transformers films we’ve seen in the past. Bay says:</p><p>I wanted the first <i>Transformers</i> to be very suburban and less cool, this is a much more cinematic one. I focused on keeping this one slick. There won’t be any goofiness in this one. We went a bit too goofy [on the last one]. It feels like a new chapter, this movie, but it’s not a reboot. This movie lives in the history of the <i>Transformers</i> movies, and this one starts three years after the last. It feels fresh.</p><p>I’ll remain skeptical about Age of Extinction until I actually watch the film. Michael Bay’s movies are full of immature humor that almost ruins most of his films, especially the <i>Transformers</i> movies. Need I remind you of Devastator’s balls and Wheelie humping Megan Fox’s leg? Nevertheless, Transformers: Age of Extinction will be one of the must-see movies of summer 2014 for many moviegoers.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the latest issue of <a href=#>Empire Magazine</a>, new <a href=#>plot details and character descriptions</a> have emerged from the new Transformers film. Mark Wahlberg will play a struggling inventor named Cade Yeager, while Nicola Peltz will play his teenage daughter Tessa. Irish actor Jack Reynor will play Tessa’s secret racer boyfriend Shane Dyson. Interestingly, Chinese female actor Li Bingbing is described as “the CEO of the Chinese Transformers,” which is odd because I didn’t know Transformers had nationalities.</p><p>The film’s plot description seems oddly similar to plot details leaked from the Michigan Film Office (the state where Age of Extinction was shot) last year. Apparently, Transformers 4 will feature an unearthing of old Transformers.</p><p>Earth is scarred by the events of the past three movies, but is moving on after all the giant robots disappeared. Cade Yeager, an inventor, discovers a buried Transformer which sets the stage for the return of the rest of the Transformers.</p><p>Read the details from the <a href=#>Michigan Film Office</a> below:</p><p>As humanity picks up the pieces, following the conclusion of <i>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</i>, Autobots and Decepticons have all but vanished from the face of the planet. However, a group of powerful, ingenious businessman and scientists attempt to learn from past Transformer incursions and push the boundaries of technology beyond what they can control — all while an ancient, powerful Transformer menace sets Earth in his crosshairs. The epic adventure and battle between good and evil, freedom and enslavement ensues.</p><p>I guess the big question is: who is the Transformer that Cade discovers? Could it be Megatron, who died at the end of Dark of the Moon, or perhaps the Dinobots?</p><p>The new Transformers film also stars Stanley Tucci, Sophia Myles, T.J. Miller, Victoria Summer, Li Bingbing, Titus Welliver, Kelsey Grammer, and Peter Cullen. Transformers: Age of Extinction hits theaters everywhere on June 27, 2014, in 3D and IMAX.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irk56zqnvMopqhmZWheqOt2Garq5meqLOwvsyeqaxlkZyybrHXraCnm6SevK95xqimn7FencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-momoa-on-parenting-vulnerability-and-the-struggle-to-get-by.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Momoa on Parenting, Vulnerability, and the Struggle to Get By</span></a>
