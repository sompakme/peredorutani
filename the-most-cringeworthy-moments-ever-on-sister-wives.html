The wives bicker throughout the episode, questioning each other's commitment to the business and sales savvy. Kody, of course, inserts his own brand of patriarchal drama as the wives try to hash it out amongst themselves. At first, the episode is not exactly "cringey"– sure, it is awkward to watch Robyn and Meri trade jabs over soup and salad, but then comes the piece de resistance:&nbsp;the Big Presentation.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Let's not mince words: this thing is unbelievably difficult to watch. There are multiple instances of forgotten words and rambling speeches as the wives nervously pitch their jewelry business. In one scene, Robyn straight-up looks like she might upchuck on the floor as the investors stare slack-jawed as if they are watching, well, a particularly gnarly episode of a reality show. Viewers were not exactly charitable about the pitch, either. Said one <a href=#>Reddit</a> commenter of the products: "It's amazing how bad the jewelry was. The pieces looked like a little girl's doodlings." Oof. If you have any sort of fear of public speaking (or an aversion to polygamy-themed jewelry), avoid this episode at all costs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9obH55e9OhnGaln6jBbq%2FRoqWgnaekv7W02GakqKWVo8G0ecSvnKtln6N6tLXSrZyrZaeew6a%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terry-allen-kramer-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Terry Allen Kramer Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
