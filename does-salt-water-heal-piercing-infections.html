Removing the piercing can allow the wound to close, trapping the infection within the skin. For this reason, it is advisable not to remove an earring from an infected ear unless advised by a doctor or professional piercer.<h2>What does an infected piercing look like?</h2>Your piercing might be infected if: the area around it is swollen, painful, hot, very red or dark (depending on your skin colour) there's blood or pus coming out of it – pus can be white, green or yellow.<h2>Is table salt okay for piercings?</h2>If you want to use a water/salt mixture to clean your piercings it's important that you only use sea salt and not table salt.<h2>Does salt water sting piercings?</h2>Never ever use more than the recommended salt or less/more water. Salt is a preservative and too much will burn and irritate your piercing.<h2>How do you heal a piercing bump?</h2>A sea salt solution is a natural way to keep the piercing clean, help it heal, and reduce any swelling that may be causing an unsightly bump. A person can dissolve ⅛ to ¼ of a teaspoon of sea salt in 1 cup of warm distilled or bottled water, rinse the piercing with the solution, then gently pat it dry.<h2>Should I clean the crust off my piercing?</h2>Due to the type of puncture wound a piercing is, it's important to remove the crust that develops around your earring or on the outside of your piercing.

Pustules are a sign of an infection, and they can be filled with blood and even pus. Ouch!<h2>Can an infected ear piercing spread?</h2>Without proper treatment, ear piercing infections can spread to the rest of your body. This is called a systemic infection. The infection can also get worse or form an abscess. An abscess is an area of the skin that is swollen and filled with pus.<h2>When should you give up on a piercing?</h2><p>Here are some of the biggest ones.</p><li>You've tried to have the area pierced a number of times, but it just won't stick. ...</li><li>You start to feel uncomfortable wearing your piercing. ...</li><li>You can't stick to the aftercare period. ...</li><li>Your piercing constantly gets in the way. ...</li><li>Your piercing is causing health issues.</li><h2>Why is my piercing not healing?</h2>Excessive rubbing or friction can irritate your skin and delay healing. Keep the jewelry in place. Most piercings heal within about six weeks, but some might take several months or longer to heal. To maintain the piercing, leave the jewelry in place during this time, even at night, to keep the hole from closing.<h2>Will piercing bump go away?</h2>Piercing bumps can be caused by allergies, genetics, poor aftercare, or just bad luck. With treatment, they may disappear completely.<h2>What color should piercing crust be?</h2>Crusties—the nickname for the clear or yellow caking that forms around a healing body piercing. Crusties are the result of your body trying to heal itself. This is simply a mix of lymphatic fluid, epithelial debris and dead blood cells which seeps out clear and dries to a yellowish color when exposed to air.<h2>When will piercing stop crusting?</h2>After cleaning the site for a few weeks, you will see less and less crusting until, eventually, it all disappears. This is not a process of one-size-fits-all. For some people the crusting goes away in two or three weeks–for others, it can take four or five weeks.<h2>How do I know if my piercing is healing?</h2>You'll know your ear is healed once any discharge, swelling, redness, flaking, or soreness stops.
