Men from the ’70s era that took opportunity by the horns. Charlie was unapologetic about his ambition and desire to carve out a place in the world.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“He made a way for his family and set an example for generations to come. He was a character that moved through the world with a certainty and swagger that made people take notice. He deserved to have his story told. It was an honor to portray him. He will never be forgotten.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Added producer Mike Regen: “We could go on and on about Charlie’s accomplishments and the impact he had on so many, but we also know Charlie would tell us to get back to work. And that is exactly what we will do to continue to honor his legacy and amazing life.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Survivors include his wife of 63 years, Annett; daughters Charlette and Ruedell; son Charles Jr.; 11 grandchildren; and 13 great-grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKS0wKujop1drK6tt8SrZJ2dkZl6tK3NZp2rmZ6YtrSvzmagnKeeYn5zf5RsaG5taWh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./photos-of-sheriff-blubs-and-deputy-durland-on-mycast.html><span>←</span><span>Photos of Sheriff Blubs and Deputy Durland on myCast</span></a>
