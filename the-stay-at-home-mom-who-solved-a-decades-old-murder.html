"So I was reading," she told BBC, "and then I remember looking to the right and there was Angie. I thought, 'Am I dreaming? Am I asleep? What is it?'"</p><p>Taking this encounter as a sign that it was time to figure things out once and for all, Sheila started making phone calls — roughly 700 of them, by her estimates. She phoned the <a href=#>police</a> again and again and was, by her recollection, largely blown off. Later that year, she went so far as to become a licensed private investigator, all in the hopes of landing a little more clout with law enforcement.</p><p>Eventually, police reopened the investigation, assigning a female detective to the case. They dug up evidence that was thought to be lost, including <a href=#>DNA</a> pulled from bodily fluids and skin found under Samota's fingernails. In the end, it was concluded that Angela's murderer was Donald Bess, a convicted rapist out on parole at the time of the killing. Already in prison for a different charge by then, he was given the death penalty and is currently awaiting execution, according to the <a href=#>Texas DoJ</a>.</p><p>Oh, also. After the trial concluded, Sheila apologized to Russell Buchanan, which he probably appreciated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BknFpb2lfqbWmedKtmLJlkal6qbvMnmSmp51ixKm7jKympa6VmXqiecOempqclah6sLjDZqSuqpSav3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./skippa-da-flippa-disses-former-labelmate-quavo-you-ain-t-the-boss-of-sh-t.html><span>←</span><span>Skippa Da Flippa Disses Former Labelmate Quavo: &amp;quot;You Ain't The Boss Of Sh*t&amp;quot;</span></a>
