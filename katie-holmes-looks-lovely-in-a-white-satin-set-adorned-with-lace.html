Up top, Holmes wore a loose-fitting, high-neck tank top that featured a frilly translucent collar and ornate floral lace in a wide band along the hem, shoulders, and down the sides of the bodice, paired with a matching A-line midi skirt that featured the same delicate lace along the hem and down each side. She added a bit of edge to the romantic, feminine set in the form of tall shiny black croc-embossed boots with a short block heel. Holmes went sans jewelry for the day, kept her makeup natural, fresh, and glowy, and styled her wavy hair in a sophisticated updo with her short face-framing bangs hanging loose.</p><img alt="new york, new york february 10 katie holmes attends the alice olivia by stacey bendet presentation during february 2024 new york fashion week at highline stages on february 10, 2024 in new york city photo by jed cullendave benettgetty images" title="alice + olivia By Stacey Bendet - Presentation - February 2024 New York Fashion Week" width=3815 height=5912 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2001016589-65c9210a70d44.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Dave Benett</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On Saturday night, the Batman Begins actor traded flowy satin for double denim and lots of layering at Stacey Bendet’s Alice + Olivia presentation. Holmes’s chic ensemble consisted of a cropped, fitted beige blazer that featured a dramatic collar and lapels, with sleeves she scrunched up to three-quarters length, over a light-wash denim button-up shirt and black high-neck tank top. She tucked her shirt into a pair of darker-wash low-waisted, bootcut jeans and paired it with a pop of color in the form of sheer hot-pink socks, which she wore with black strappy, square-toe sandals. For some final touches, Holmes added a small crisp white purse and gold chain necklace. She glammed up with pinky blush, champagne eye shadow, and a shimmery brown-pink lip while wearing her rich brown locks down and straight.</p><img alt="new york, new york february 09 katie holmes attends the prada makeup and skincare launch party at skylight at the refinery in brooklyn on february 09, 2024 in new york city photo by gothamgc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - February 09, 2024" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1999342311-65c921142b4f6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Gotham</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For a big Friday night out, at the Prada Makeup launch party, Holmes exuded elegance while mixing colors and textures. She wore an eye-catching satin lime-green midi skirt over sheer black tights, paired with a cozy slate-gray wool cardigan with shiny jewel-adorned buttons. She kept her accents classic, with black pointed-toe slingback heels and a sleek black purse, and added some more luxury in the form of mesmerizing diamond-shaped aquamarine drop earrings. Holmes complemented the refined ensemble with a wet-hair look and dewy makeup, complete with a rosy blush and dark berry lip.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
