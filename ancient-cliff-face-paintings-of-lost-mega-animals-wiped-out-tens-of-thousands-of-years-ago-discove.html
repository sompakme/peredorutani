published an analysis of the cliff face paintings in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Quaternary International</a> journal.</p><p>Study co-researcher Mark Robinson, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter, said: "These really are incredible images, produced by the earliest people to live in western Amazonia.</p><p>He added: "The paintings give a vivid and exciting glimpse into the lives of these communities.</p><p>"It is unbelievable to us today to think they lived among, and hunted, giant herbivores, some which were the size of a small car."</p><p>People in the UK can watch a documentary about the paintings on Channel 4 on December 5 at 6:30pm.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Giant sloths – the key facts</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Here's what you need to know...</p><ul><li>Megatherium is the official name for a genus of elephant-sized ground sloths native to South America</li><li>They're better known as giant growth sloths, and lived from the early Pliocene, an epoch that began 5.333million years ago</li><li>Sadly, giant sloths became extinct roughly around 8,500 BC</li><li>There were only a few other land mammals that were bigger than Megatherium, making them one of the world's most interesting megafauna</li><li>The first fossil specimen of Megatherium was discovered in Argentina in 1788</li><li>Since then, more fossils have been found across South America, including in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay</li><li>They're one of the biggest land mammals known to have ever existed</li><li>They could weigh up to 4 tonnes, and measured up to 6 metres (20 foot) in length</li><li>The creatures were herivorous, and had huge curved claws for pulling down far-away branches</li><li>Giant sloths largely walked on all fours, but trackways reveal that they were capable of walking on two legs at times too</li></ul><span
