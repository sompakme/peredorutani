"Even Rhea won four for ", he quipped.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1hEtjlAWcT data-wc=37>Despite their separation, the couple have stayed close. Their three kids, Lucy - who joined her parents on the red carpet, Grace and Jake have all grown up. But what is the secret to their post-split harmony?</p><p id=e-JW0DfI_Wq data-wc=17><strong>Louella Alderson, relationship expert and co-founder of dating site <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>So Syncd</a>, exclusively shared her thoughts with HELLO!</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Danny DeVito joins estranged wife Rhea Perlman at the Emmys</figure><p id=eD56wqPtIt data-wc=44>“It's heartwarming to see Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman continue to support each other even after their separation over 10 years ago", she said. "This speaks to the strong bond they have built over their long marriage and as parents to their three children."</p><p id=eBCPJ80Z_2j data-wc=64>"While it isn’t always easy for couples to maintain a friendly relationship after divorce or separation, it shows that Danny and Rhea had a deep connection that they felt was worth sustaining despite deciding to go their separate ways after 30 years of marriage. When this is done for the right reasons, it’s a testament to the purity of the love for one another."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47c0ec7a5b66-danny-devito-rhea-perlman.jpg><p id=e156e2UNvk data-wc=31>She continued: "Sometimes, a romantic connection between two people can change over time and fizzle out, but it doesn't always mean that the love and care for each other is gone."</p><p id=eOApHqd9_ek data-wc=48>"In cases like Danny and Rhea, they had 40 years of history together, and that bond can continue to exist even after their marriage has ended. Some couples can find a way to move past the hurt and disappointment of a failed marriage and maintain a strong friendship."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/94ff7328ae8e-gettyimages-1585120549.jpg><p id=eeXXqpMLW6 data-wc=15>In fact Rhea has spoken about how difficult it was to reconcile after their separation.</p><p id=eJBuVTeIfat data-wc=67>Speaking to Julia Louis-Dreyfus on her Wiser Than Me podcast, the Barbie actress revealed: "I'm not going to like sugarcoat it, it was difficult. It was very difficult at first. There were a lot of reasons as to why we separated, which I'm not going to go into. But it took time for us to come to this somehow pretty decent understanding and relationship with each other."</p><p id=eG9Flbb4Jgj data-wc=38>Louella added that "their appearance at the Emmys together speaks volumes about their love for each other as people rather than just ex-spouses. It's admirable that they continue to support each other in different aspects of their lives."</p><p id=eu2CsrpQ9CL data-wc=60>This backs up another thing that Rhea confirmed on the podcast, which is that: "Danny and I have always loved each other. We have three amazing children together, and we really agree on almost everything important. Our relationship] is much better because all the tense stuff is gone. Not in your face, I'm not in his, he's not in mine."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Danny DeVito, 79, gives shoutout to estranged wife Rhea Perlman, 75, at the Emmys" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/af4b24f550fe-danny-devito-wife-and-daughter.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Danny DeVito, 79, gives shoutout to estranged wife Rhea Perlman, 75, at the Emmys" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Danny DeVito, 79, gives shoutout to estranged wife Rhea Perlman, 75, at the Emmys</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ebFPuBMUku data-wc=33>It's important to note that Rhea and Danny never got divorced, and they never plan to.

That’s okay too. There are many reasons why marriages don't work out, and it's important for individuals to look after their own well-being and happiness. It appears that in Danny and Rhea's case, remaining in each others' lives was the best decision for them and their family."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
