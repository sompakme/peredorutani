Eazy-E, was a member of N.W.A. in the 1980s, releasing albums like the double-platinum "Straight Outta Compton," <a href=#>per Biography</a>. He died of complications from AIDS in 1995, aged just 30. At Eazy-E's funeral, <a href=#>the Los Angeles Times reports</a> a manager from his record label eulogized, "People will talk and say evil and vicious things. But your legacy will survive." Eazy-E's cause of death was definitely on people's minds. One 17-year-old fan who was interviewed outside his funeral said, "His death really scared me. But I hope it will make more young people think about what they are doing out there."</p><p dir=ltr><a href=#>According to Find a Grave</a>, Eazy-E is buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier, California. While originally buried under a small stone, <a href=#>TMZ reported</a> that it was replaced by a much flashier one in 2019, in honor of Eazy-E's 55th birthday. It is covered in photos and reads "The Godfather of Gangsta Rap, he put Compton on the map. We loved him, but God loved him more." It also includes Eazy-E's correct birth year: The original stone had 1963 instead of 1964.</p><p dir=ltr>The man who created the new tombstone, Cemetery Tim, said, "It was a lot of pressure ... I want to represent Eazy-E the best I can, so I'm relistening to the songs ... Now I'm really paying attention to the lyrics ... Being in the industry, I was like, if I ever got a chance to get to work on his stone, I'm gonna give it my all."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCk3BwaW9frLWmvsRmq6Gdo5p6p63MqKysZWhlwG6%2F05qprGWRp7JurtSroJ6cXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./watch-columbus-lafc-soccer-online-free-the-hollywood-reporter.html><span>←</span><span>Watch Columbus LAFC Soccer Online Free The Hollywood Reporter</span></a>
