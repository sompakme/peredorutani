"It was quite a departure from the traditional posed-up wedding image but really reflected the spirit of this dynamic couple, conveying both their sense of humour and love for each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c258f719c17-justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-wedding-cover-hello-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=elefEQXnuPVtn data-wc=10><strong>The couple will celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary next week</strong></p><p id=ev2FOPQYs7GYO data-wc=52>"They may be one of Hollywood's most high-profile couples but what was touching was how excited they were to share their happiness with <strong>HELLO! </strong>and our readers. They couldn't have been more candid – or funny – in their interview and <a class=hm-link href=#>the photos were remarkable</a> for their intimacy and naturalness, with Justin showing his joker side!"</p><p id=envUUGh44NicI data-wc=86>The couple, who have a <a class=hm-link href=#>two-year-old son Silas</a>, said "I do" on 19 October 2012. They chose the magnificent <a class=hm-link href=#>Borgo Egnazia resort in Puglia</a> for their nuptials, with Justin serenading his love as she walked down the aisle. "I figured if there was something I was going to be able to offer, it would be to sing her down the aisle," the groom told us at the time. Jessica, who admitted she "had a little bit of butterflies" before the ceremony, looked exquisite in a custom petal pink Giambattista Valli Haute Couture gown.</p><p id=eD0hCDHVEERLE data-wc=50>The couple also explained why they chose Italy ("We love to eat!") and how they were "so excited to have this moment and share it with our family and friends," who included close pals comedian Jimmy Fallon, star Andy Samberg, musician Timbaland and Jessica's co-star Beverley Mitchell.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
