Well-wishers were quick to send the star their support, with many sharing their own stories. "My Mama has been in my heart and on my mind for 15 years," one wrote. "It hurts a tiny bit less now. Stay strong my dear." Another added: "Like your beautiful mama said, 'Take your broken heart and make it into art.""</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eLDYy3zlv9oP data-wc=82>The 24-year-old&nbsp;<strong class=redactor-inline-converted><a class=hm-link href=#>broke her silence following</a>&nbsp;</strong>the deaths of her mother Carrie and grandmother Debbie Reynolds, who sadly passed awa<a class=hm-link href=#>y just one day apart</a>&nbsp;in December,&nbsp;last week. Sharing a photo of herself with them, she wrote: "Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist.

He told : "Carrie loves a good party, so, you know, I'm sure [Billie will] want to throw a party for her." He also confirmed that he and his niece had a joint decision to have Carrie's ashes placed in a Prozac pill shaped urn, explaining to : "Carrie's favourite possession was a giant Prozac pill that she bought many years ago. A big pill. She loved it, and it was in her house, and Billie and I felt it was where she'd want to be. We couldn't find anything appropriate. Carrie would like that. It was her favourite thing, and so that's how you do it. And so they're together, and they will be together here and in heaven, and we're okay with that."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
