Longinus was already on the losing end of a battle with Antony and Octavian that same year, and as a result, he took his own life. The Roman Republican army would clash one last time with Antony and Octavian, however, this time, under the command of Brutus.</p><p dir=ltr>Following the success Octavian and Antony had against Longinus, Brutus mounted a counter-assault but the conditions were perilous. This prevented the cavalry from playing a part in the conflict, and so foot soldiers fought hand-to-hand, according to <a href=#>Britannica</a>. Brutus would retreat, along with a good portion of his army, but soon, Antony's cavalry hemmed in their encampment. Facing defeat, Brutus killed himself, and his troops surrendered.</p><p>Although they emerged that day victorious, the outcome for Octavian and Antony wasn't much better than the fate of Brutus and Longinus. The two military leaders would eventually turn against one another, Octavian ascending to Emperor, and Antony himself committing suicide a short time later, changing the course of Roman history for good, according to <a href=#>Manchester Historian</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCk25ucW9fnby4ecOim2aaoqrBtr%2BMnaCeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fact-check-was-ronaldo-s-unveiling-event-at-al-nassr-viewed-more-than-2022-world-cup-final.html><span>←</span><span>Fact Check: Was Ronaldos Unveiling Event at Al-Nassr Viewed More Than 2022 World Cup Final?</span></a>
