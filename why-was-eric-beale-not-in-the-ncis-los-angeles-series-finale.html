Scott Gemmill said when asked why Barret Foa was missing in the final episode.</p><p>“If I’d had the time and the money, I would have probably had everybody who had ever been on the show. We couldn’t do everything we wanted to, unfortunately,” he added while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to TVLine</a>.</p><p>“Getting to play Eric Beale one last time would have been a dream, so I was bummed when it didn’t work out,” Barrett Foa told TVLine.</p><p>“I’m grateful he got a shout-out and that he’s out there making the world a better place. How cool that CBS gave the show a chance to give our fans a proper series finale,” Barrett elaborated.</p><p>Despite not being around for the series finale, it is notable that Eric Beale is still alive and well inside the NCIS Universe.</p><p>This makes it possible for the character to return at some point down the road. With how open-ended the finale was for the NCIS spin-off, a special or TV movie could easily be made from the source material.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Maybe Eric Beale could appear on another NCIS show?</h2><p>Huge news revealed that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LL Cool J joined the NCIS: Hawai’i cast</a>. He will continue playing Agent Sam Hanna and give the newer NCIS show some star power.</p><p>Having a character entrenched in a new show makes it easier to bring back additional people. Maybe a future episode of NCIS: Hawai’i could use Eric Beale and Nell Jones in a tech case that Ernie Malik (Jason Antoon) has to solve.</p><p>For now, fans of Nell and Eric will have to enjoy seeing them in older episodes of NCIS: LA. They were integral parts of the first 12 seasons. All of the episodes from those seasons are available for streaming on Paramount+.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Looking ahead, NCIS: Hawai’i Season 3 has been ordered for the 2023-2024 television season.
