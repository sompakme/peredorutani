The site was intended exclusively for those who studied at that time in Harvard.</p><p class=align-left>Users could register, create their own pages, put the information about themselves, and then share the comments about university news, music, movies, sports. It is unlikely that then someone could have guessed that Zuckerberg had made a genuine revolution. He offered people a way of communication, which has become an integral part of the life of a third of the world's population.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d93e9e51ffadb669.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>MTN begs Nigerians as millions of subscribers suffer network failure</span></p></a><h2>Who is the founder of Facebook?</h2><p class=align-left>Soon the creator of "Facebook" Mark Zuckerberg realized that for the development of the project you need a lot of investment. Therefore, taking an example from Bill Gates, he left Harvard, and all the money put aside by his parents for study ($ 85,000) was invested in 'his child'. In the summer of 2004, the programmer moved to Palo Alto. He registered his project as a legal entity, becoming CEO of Facebook.</p><p class=align-left>Later, Mark Zuckerberg managed to attract wealthy investors to the project, which helped him to develop the social network to a global level. Among the investors are, Sean Parker, co-founder of the payment system "PayPal" Peter Teal, who invested half a million dollars, and the creator of the first business social network "Linkedin" Reed Hoffman.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Facebook narcissism and low self-esteem: How are they connected?</p><p class=align-left>In 2005, Mark Zuckerberg bought a Facebook.com domain for $ 200,000.

In 2008, the programmer opened the company's international headquarters in Dublin, and in 2009 publicly announced first profit. Since that moment, the Facebook social network has opened platform codes for everyone who wants to create new applications for the project, so that about 140 new applications are downloaded to the site every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d93e9e51ffadb669.jpg><h2>Interesting facts from the history of Facebook social network</h2><ul><li>In order to give the name to his project, Mark Zuckerberg did not break his head for a long time.

The full title of this book sounded like this - "The Photo Address Book" ("Address Book with Photos").</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9220ec036d1c3533.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>BREAKING: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp services back online after huge global shut down, Zuckerberg reacts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But the guys called it "The Facebook". Mark removed the article "the" from the site name only in 2005 after buying the domain name facebook.com for 200 thousand dollars. The main color of the site was and remains blue.</p><p class=align-left>He does not distinguish between red and green colors and so blue work very well.

For this, he was almost expelled from Harvard. On February 10, 2004, three undergraduates - Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra - accused Zuckerberg of being deceived.</p><p class=align-left>Students claimed that Mark promised to help them create a social network HarvardConnection.com, and he, using their designs and ideas, worked on creating a "competing software product."
