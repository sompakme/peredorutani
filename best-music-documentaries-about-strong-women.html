Cutler of The September Issue, we are shown just how it happened.&nbsp; What feels like home movies of Billie and her close-knit family, including songwriting/producing partner and brother, Finneas, show how her album, videos, and tours were meticulously created while she managed serious anxiety and health issues. Oh, and she was still but a teen.</p><p>It’s a peek-through-the-window view of the making of a decidedly unique and special modern-day pop star that’s perfect for the generation, who needs to know everything about their musical obsessions and excellent for those curious to learn what all the hype is about.</p><span class="c-span buy-now__title lrv-u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-font-weight-700 lrv-u-font-size-28 u-font-size-34@tablet lrv-u-line-height-small lrv-u-display-block">'The World's A Little Bit Blurry' on Apple TV+</span><p><span class="c-span buy-now__price pmc-product-price lrv-u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-font-size-20 lrv-u-color-grey-dark u-font-size-21@tablet u-letter-spacing-012">$4.99</span></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8188034188034><h2>Taylor Swift — ‘Miss Americana’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/billie-eilish.jpg><p>When this documentary was released, Taylor Swift was <a href=#>a hugely successful singer-songwriter</a> who had released 7 albums and won a laundry list of awards.
