The outlet reported that her 2003 song "Lights Out" spoke of her family's graveyard and how it would haunt her to see a spot left because it reminded her of her own mortality. Ever one for dark humor, Presley quipped one other idea for her life after death on the more macabre side. "I don't plan on anything. I'm sure I'll end up there ... Or I'll shrink my head and put it in a glass box in the living room. I'll get more tourists to Graceland that way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmbH16gY6loKyZXaKus7XEZqernaOhsrq%2FjJ%2Bgp5mcYr%2Bmv9OipaBloKGupLGMsKClpF2irqyxjLKmrmWVory1tc6nmKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-expecting-second-child.html><span>←</span><span>Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott 'expecting second child'</span></a>
