An annual staple, Pride in the Park includes a range of live shows. Musicians, artists, and other entertainers all show up to entertain attendees. Sadly, the event was canceled two years in a row due to the COVID pandemic. In 2022, the celebration made its triumphant return to LA State Historic Park. It featured performances from artists like Christina Aguilera and Anitta. This year promises to be no less exciting with headliners like Meg and Mariah. Both artists have rabid fanbases and a large presence in the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Mariah has not been the subject of much drama recently, but Megan Thee Stallion has certainly been making headlines. She has recently been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle against <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tory Lanez</a>. In 2020, she accused Lanez of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">shooting her in the foot</a>. The two had been leaving a party together and got into an altercation, resulting in the injury. It was a long road for Meg, but it was worth it. As of December, a jury found Lanez <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">guilty of the crime</a>. Subsequently, he has now filed a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">motion for retrial.</a> If the original verdict is upheld, Lanez will be looking at 22 years of prison time. He will also face deportation to his home country of Canada once his sentence has been served. The outcome is still unknown, but Meg is already moving on. She has announced that she is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">working on new music</a> and now has <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">several large headlining gigs</a> lined up.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-mariah-and-meg-pay-tribute-to-lgbtq-fans>Mariah And Meg Pay Tribute To LGBTQ+ Fans</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Both Mariah and Megan took to social media to announce their co-headlining gig. They expressed excitement about the opportunity to perform, acknowledging their fans in the community in the process. "I'm thrilled and honored to be a part of LA Pride 2023," Mariah said on her Instagram. "I am happy to be back in-person celebrating the LGBTQIA+ community here in Southern California and throughout all of the lands!!!" Meg also made a statement expressing her appreciation of the event's inclusivity and diversity. "I can’t wait to headline LA Pride in the Park and celebrate the phenomenal LGBTQIA+ community," said Meg. "This incredible event advocates diversity, inclusivity, and equality, so I’m honored to perform and have a blast with all of the Hotties in attendance."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Both artists seem to be in good places in their lives, respectively. Mariah recently celebrated her 54th birthday on vacation with her boyfriend and her kids. She was beaming in videos and pictures posted to her Instagram, where she showed love to her fans and family. In Megan's case, her comeback is in full effect after she took a small hiatus during the court case against Lanez. Though the battle is ongoing, the December verdict was a huge win for her. What better way to celebrate than performing at Pride?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoBzgZFmpJ6fkaN6rq3RopihZZGnsm5%2Bj2tqZqSRYr2ztcOeZKGdkZm5qrrEq6o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mariah-carey-announces-eagerly-anticipated-tour-the-adventures-of-mimi-the-voice-the-hits.html><span>←</span><span>Mariah Carey Announces Eagerly-Anticipated Tour THE ADVENTURES OF MIMI: THE VOICE, THE HITS,</span></a>
