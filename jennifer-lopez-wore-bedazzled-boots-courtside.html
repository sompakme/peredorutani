Diverting everyone's attention away from the game (perhaps even the players), J.Lo's boots weren't just rhinestone-studded but also featured a controversial wedge heel. She teamed her eye-catching footwear with high-waisted wide-leg jeans, a cropped white T-shirt, and even more glitter in the form of a pink-and-beige sequined tweed blazer.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few J.Lo signatures (gold hoops, aviator sunglasses, a fistful of diamond rings) finished off her courstside outfit, while a sleek blowout, a bronzy contour, and nude lips completed her glam.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lopez attended the game with her husband, Ben Affleck — who dressed casually in a plaid flannel shirt, a navy blue jacket, matching trousers, and a baseball cap — as well as her 12-year-old stepson, Samuel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">J.Lo's latest family outing comes just a couple months before she embarks on her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>upcoming This Is Me Now...
