She styled her freshly-dyed strands sleek and straight with a middle part and tucked behind her shoulders, allowing them to effortlessly cascade down her back. The reality star matched her new hair color to her dress, a beige suede Chrome Hearts design with a gold-chain halter neck top, a cutout from behind, and a series of cross patches emblazoned on the bodice and skirt.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kim kept her accessories to a minimum, adding only a smattering of gold and diamond rings to her long, brown manicured fingers. Her glam coordinated with her outfit's natural color palette, and included a nude lip, copper-colored eyeshadow, and a bronzy glow.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the award ceremony, Kim was named Tycoon of the Year following the successful launch of her SKIMS men's collection and exclusive underwear partnership with the NBA. During an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a>, Kim explained that her dad is the one who sparked her interest in menswear and clothing in general.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He always wanted to look cool,” says Kim of her dad, before revealing that she worked at the trendy Encino clothing store Body when she was a teenager. “Diesel was one of the brands we carried. They had a cool pair of jeans. They were wax-coated. My dad’s office was really close by, so he’d always stop in. He said, ‘I have to have those.’ I got them for him. He would wear them with just a black T-shirt and a loafer.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlmKS7psWMm6OoppSaeqmtyKtkoKldorKvec6fZK2glWLGpq3RZpiwmaKZwG6Ek2lqcmpm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenny-lattimore-height-biography-wiki-age-wife-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kenny Lattimore Height, Biography, Wiki, Age, Wife, Net Worth</span></a>
