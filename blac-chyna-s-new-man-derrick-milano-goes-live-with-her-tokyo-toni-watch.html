Seeing as she grew up with a mother like Tokyo Toni, it's understandable that emotions can be difficult for the former OnlyFans creator to express. Nevertheless, she's put in <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">tremendous work</a> on herself in recent years in order to heal not only her maternal wound but also any emotions left behind from her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">toxic relationships</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tyga</a> and Rob Kardashian. After dedicating time to herself and her spiritual practice, fans think that Chyna may have found the perfect man for her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In late September, the 35-year-old went Instagram official with Derrick Milano, a talented singer-songwriter who she aspires to become a power couple with. "They always say don’t go looking for love, let love find you. In…&nbsp; this case love found us," Chyna revealed in a statement to PEOPLE last week. Now that the news is out in the open, she and Milano are happily sharing their love with fans on Live. In the video below, the mother of two shares silly moments with Toni, proving just how far their bond has come from their tense feud in the spring.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-blac-chyna-and-derrick-milano-share-their-love-with-fans-on-live>Blac Chyna and Derrick Milano Share Their Love with Fans on Live</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Near the 3:15 mark, the 29-year-old appears in the frame next to his partner, nervously smiling while she shows him off. In the back, Chyna's mother continues to yell, but Milano doesn't seem phased. "Aw, ain't they such a cute couple?" Toni asks before returning to yelling about needing a beat to rap over.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tokyo Toni's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">attitude</a> has calmed down significantly over the past few months, but that hasn't stopped her from talking recklessly about some of the biggest names in the industry. Blac Chyna's mom has been putting her pen game to work lately, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">crafting bars</a> that throw shade at the likes of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Beyonce</a>.
