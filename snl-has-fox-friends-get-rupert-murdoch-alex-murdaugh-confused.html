A <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/rupert-murdoch-fox-sued-biden-presidential-ad-1235340559/>complaint was filed against&nbsp;Fox Corp.&nbsp;and Murdoch</a>&nbsp;on Friday over allegations that the network chief gave confidential information to former president Donald Trump’s campaign in 2020.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m surprised because I’m such a fan of dominions. The little yellow guys with the overalls,” Bowen Yang’s Brian Kilmeade responded. Day’s Doocy clarified that he’s not talking about minions, the babbling species from Despicable Me, but the Dominion voting machines lawsuit: “Our boss, Rupert Murdoch gave some pretty shocking testimony in the case.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Heidi Gardner’s Ainsley Earhard cuts into the conversation, complaining that “this whole trial has been so unfair.

They got the wrong guy,” Gardner’s Earhard said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The hosts then went on to mention why Fox News isn’t covering the lawsuit much on its shows. “Anyway, Rupert Murdoch admitted that Fox News aired election fraud conspiracies to get ratings, even though everyone at Fox knew they were false,” Day’s Doocy continued. “Uh oh, I didn’t. Loop a brother in next time,” Yang’s Kilmeade responded, looking confused.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Travis Kelce, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>whose Kansas City Chiefs triumphed</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;Super Bowl&nbsp;LVII in Februrary, made his hosting debut Saturday night, with musical guest&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_kelsea-ballerini_1 data-tag=kelsea-ballerini>Kelsea Ballerini</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrJitraKZrrp5zaKeoaxdoba3sYycpqWcXaS9prqMq6ypnaKpeq7B0Z2mnKBdlrmmxIymrKuckaq0qXnCqKWfraOasW59kWxsbGxhZ4J6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-dem-marry-when-dem-born-gospel-singer-tim-godfrey-and-wife-welcome-1st-child-fans-react.html><span>←</span><span>When Dem Marry When Dem Born: Gospel Singer Tim Godfrey and Wife Welcome 1st Child, Fans React</span></a>
