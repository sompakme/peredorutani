Remove the positive wire from the solenoid on the top of the starter by unscrewing it. Because the earth is fastened in with the bottom bolt, it will be removed as soon as the bottom bolt is withdrawn from the ground.</p><h3></h3><h3>When you have a Jeep Compass, how do you replace the starter?</h3><p>REMOVAL Raise the car by opening the hood. Remove the air cleaner box as well as the air tubing. Disconnect and disconnect the negative cable from the battery. Remove the bolt that holds the starting motor in place.
