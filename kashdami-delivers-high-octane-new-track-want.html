He unveiled a snippet of the catchy track a couple of months back, which earned him quite a bit of attention online. Countless fans and even <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a>'s son co-signed the single on social media, and have been waiting for the full release since.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Reportedly, the track will appear on the Las Vegas-born performer's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">upcoming album</a>, Oasis. It's unclear when the new project is scheduled to drop, but based on listeners' reactions to his latest release, they can't wait. His comments section is flooded with praise for the single, as well as demands for more new music.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kashdami-drops-single-ahead-of-new-album-oasis>KASHDAMI Drops Single Ahead Of New Album, Oasis</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While the track appears to be a success so far, one complaint some fans have had is its length. It clocks in at only around a minute and a half long, which some say just isn't cutting it. Luckily for supporters craving more, however, KASHDAMI has already started to tease an <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">extended cut</a>. He took to his YouTube comments section to ask fans if they wanted to hear a longer version of "Want!," to which they replied with several comments along the lines of, "PLEASE BRO PLEASE."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The single sees KASHDAMI spit menacing bars about clashing with competitors, making money, and more, accompanied by dreamy production. The song also arrives alongside a cinematic music video directed by @1karlwithak. What do you think of KASHDAMI's new track? What about the song's accompanying music video? Will you be adding "Want!" to your playlist, or not? Are you looking forward to his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new album</a>, Oasis?
