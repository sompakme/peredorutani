After all, they were on the road together for six months.&nbsp;</p><p>During an <a href=#>interview</a>&nbsp;with New York's Power 105.1 radio show, The Breakfast Club, Sheeran said he and Swift never "smashed." At first, he attributed their platonic status to the fact that they met first as professionals. However, when pushed for a better answer by host Charlamagne Tha God, Sheeran shut down the rumor once and for all with a very interesting response: "Too tall," he said. "I feel like we look like cast members of&nbsp;The Hobbit."&nbsp;</p><p>So is he saying that if there wasn't a height difference, a secret rendezvous would be a go? Even though we'll probably never get an answer to that question, we can't help but wonder what a Swift song would sound like about Sheeran rather than featuring Sheeran.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhgbIV0e9KtqZqml5p6tbTIp56sZZWZerS0xJ6pmqZdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBtHnFq6CeppSotaq8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snoop-dogg-s-newborn-grandson-dies-report.html><span>←</span><span>Snoop Dogg's Newborn Grandson Dies: Report</span></a>
