The two were paired together on Season 13 of "Dancing With the Stars," and even though they made it to the semi-finals, their partnership was definitely rocky — to say the least. Less than a year after appearing on the show together, Solo released her memoir, "Solo: A Memoir of Hope."&nbsp;In her book, she detailed her experience on "Dancing With the Stars" and made some serious accusations against Chmerkovskiy. "He was often nasty... swearing at me and being harshly critical," she wrote, according to <a href=#>USA Today</a>, later adding, "he manhandled me in rehearsals from the start, pushing me, whacking my stomach, bending my arms roughly. I thought that was just how it went – how dancers worked with each other." Solo also alleged that Chmerkovskiy once smacked her face.&nbsp;Chmerkovskiy denied being physically abusive in rehearsals.</p><p>In 2015, Chmerkovskiy played a game of "f**k, marry, kill"&nbsp;on Theo Von's <a href=#>"Allegedly"</a>&nbsp;podcast, given the choice of his former&nbsp;"Dancing" partners. Perhaps to the surprise of no one, Chmerkovskiy said he'd kill Solo. "She's just a sh***y person,"&nbsp;he said. And Solo had a response. She posted a photo to <a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;of "DWTS" judges Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, and Bruno Tonioli holding up their scoring paddles, each with the number "1" on them. Solo said nothing else, but she didn't need to. It was beyond clear that she was letting Chmerkovskiy know how she felt about his comments about her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxiZoByfI6boKCflajBbrLErpusZZSWu6S1zaBksKGknXq1tMRmqq2Zoqh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-mckinley-henderson-on-the-tonys-racism-broadway-and-not-retiring.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen McKinley Henderson on the Tonys, Racism, Broadway, and Not Retiring</span></a>
