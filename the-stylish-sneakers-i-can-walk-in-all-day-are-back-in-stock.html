Luckily, the unisex kicks have recently been restocked and are now <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">available in a new color combo</a>, too. I managed to snag myself a pair of the OG style and totally get the hype.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Backstory: The moment the street-meets-recovery shoes dropped into my inbox, the obsession started based solely (no pun intended) on aesthetics. If the Nike Air Force 1 had a somewhat edgier cousin, it would be the 01 Classic. The original white-on-white style looks and feels like leather and features a light brown gummy sole, and the new white and black option is equally stylish. The brand recommends sizing down as the sneakers run big. I usually wear a 9.5 so I ordered a 9 and found that they fit perfectly.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Alo</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing I noticed when I slipped the shoes on my feet was the supportive fit — they really hug my feet and ankles, which makes them more than just street sneakers, but ones that I could wear during a workout, too. They feature amazing cushioning for this very reason, too. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Alo Yoga sneakers</a> are made with a “high-rebound recovery-foam insole” to support balance and pressure points (like the knees, feet, hips, joints, and back) for “all-day recovery.” Jumping up and down in them is actually quite fun, as you can feel a little bounce. In addition to the cushioning, the recovery foam sole offers a little height (about 2 inches) that has a slimming effect on your legs, similar to a platform heel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, let's talk about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">how to style the 01 Classic</a>. The sneakers are a great on-trend option to wear with everything from tennis skirts and maxi dresses to leggings and jeans. Anything you would wear a pair of white Nikes with, it will tackle with a little more edge. In terms of activities, I’ve sported my pair on the tennis court and in the gym for strength and weight training. While I don’t recommend the shoes for running, as they’re on the heavier side and don't have a curved toe, I have spent a day wearing mine around the city and can report that they make for great walking shoes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just as obsessed as I am?
