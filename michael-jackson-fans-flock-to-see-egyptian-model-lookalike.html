He had such a large influence on pop culture.</p><p>"Some fans are so desperate to see the model they are asking staff how to get to the Egypt exhibition before they have even bought their ticket.</p><p>"They want to touch and kiss the model like it is some sort of God but it is behind a screen to protect it from damage.</p><p>"Once people see it they are astounded and can't stop talking about its likeness. It really is remarkable."</p><p>James Phillips, curator of near east and north african exhibits, said little was known about the origins of the model.</p><p>He said: "The likeness is astonishing but I think it is probably a coincidence.</p><p>"We do not believe Michael Jackson ever visited the museum or saw the exhibit and there is therefore little chance he based his image on it.</p><p>"We believe the model is missing a nose because early Christians or Muslims removed noses from paintings and models to make them non-human.</p><p>"This was because it was against their religion to depict human beings.</p><p>"In this case it has the effect of making it look more like Michael Jackson.</p><p>"The model was carved during the New Kingdom Period but we do not know who it is or why it was made because there are no hieroglyphics on it."</p><p>The music video for Jackson's 1993 hit "<i>Remember the Time</i>" was set in Egypt and starred Eddie Murphy.</p><p>At the time of the video Jackson looked almost identical to the statue.</p><p>The model, simply called 'limestone statue of a woman', measures 25 cm high by 35 cm wide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaJulocG2vsRopK6rmZh8rrXCoZiepF2frqS30qilaG5gZoF6gJFohKKbmJayrXmpmpqkq5%2Bjeqetzaxkn6SfmLhuwM5mqp6dXXq0urzTopinZZ2ksaa4jKWmqKORobassY2hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lateysha-grace-biography-age-net-worth-boyfriend-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>Lateysha Grace biography: age, net worth, boyfriend, surgery</span></a>
