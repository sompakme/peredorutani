I’ve got a mane of unruly waves that is prone to frizz and breakage, constantly. Curl creams are a must when I’m wearing my hair natural, and a good one can get me through even the most humid of days.</p><p>Curl creams are not one size fits all, however. There are important factors to consider. For example, fine hair will need a lighter product to prevent weighing down strands, while those with tight coils will want more moisture.</p><p>Below is your go-to guide on the best curl creams for every hair type, from light waves to ringlets and tight coil curls including the <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>best selling Olaplex No 6</a> that shoppers call a <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>“hair saviour”</a>.</p><h2>HOW WE CHOOSE PRODUCTS</h2><p>With hundreds of curl creams available, it’s impossible to test every one out there. To help you find the best one we tested some well-known brands at different price points. In addition, our shopping team read hundreds of customer reviews and looked at test results and ratings from product review sites to find the best curl cream from premium to budget to help you find the right one for you.</p><h2>OUR TOP PICKS</h2><h3>In this article</h3><h2 id=U81126618609H2C>BEST CURL CREAMS FOR WAVY HAIR</h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Olaplex No. 6 Bond Smoother, $45.90 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>Olaplex’s No. 6 Bond Smoother is technically more of a reparative frizz-fighting product, but this is a strong go-to for me and many others when it comes to taming waves and gentle curls. Olaplex, if you’re not fully across, is a cult brand favoured by many hairdressers due to its incredible softening effect, even on chemically treated, ultra dry hair. You’ll often find reviews such as this one from an Amazon customer: “Let me tell you my over processed bleached hair has never felt or looked so good”.</p><p>The secret behind Olaplex comes down to what they call “patented active chemistry”. The products are said to work on a molecular level, repairing damaged hair strands that have been subjected to chemical, thermal and mechanical damage (think – overuse of your hair straightener and one too many bleach jobs).</p><p>A lot of frizzy hair issues have to do with hair damage and split ends, so finding a good reparative leave-in treatment can be key to managing unruly waves. In fact, you might find that your waves were only unruly because your mid-lengths and ends were damaged and therefore more prone to frizz.</p><p>Where many leave-in treatments can leave hair feeling weighed down and greasy, Olaplex’s Bond Smoother is incredibly lightweight. You only need a little to control strands and get the desired effect, so the small bottle might seem expensive but it does last a long time.</p><p>It’s also a multi-tasker – use on damp hair to give light control for waves when you air dry, or use prior to styling to get a smoother blow dry.</p><p>It has over 36,000 five-star reviews on Amazon with shoppers calling it a “hair saviour” and a “life changer”. It also has over 16.9 million views on TikTok. You can’t get much better than that.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Tresemme Flawless Curls Combing Cream, $16.24 (down from $19.11) at iHerb</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>This creamy formula promises to hydrate hair while also gently detangling curls to prevent frizz.</p><p>Ingredients include coconut and avocado oil, with five star reviews saying it is “great for my wavy hair” and makes hair smell “like a tropical location”.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Kérastase Curl Manifesto Creme Curl, $58.50 at Adore Beauty</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>With hero ingredients like manuka honey and ceramides to leave hair strong and shiny, this product does more than just look after your curls.</p><p>It also acts as a heat and frizz protector, all while deeply nourishing your hair and giving curls definition. Five star reviews say it has “brought my damaged hair back to life” and “really defines my curls”.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>R+CO Sail Soft Wave Spray, $54 at Adore Beauty</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>Light mists are great for taming waves without weighing them down. We love this Soft Wave Spray for its versatility – spray and scrunch damp hair to create beachy waves, or use styling tools for more defined body.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>KEVIN. MURPHY Killer Waves, $55.95 at Adore Beauty</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>My sister, who has very fine, easily weighed-down waves, swears by this mist. It provides enough grit and hold to keep waves volumised and frizz-free, but doesn’t feel greasy or heavy on even the finest of hair.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Aesop Tame Hair Serum, $43 at Myer</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>Sometimes, you just want a hair product that smells amazing. Hair really retains scent, so selecting a styling product that smells wonderful is pretty important. This Aesop serum is incredibly lightweight (perfect for finer hair types) and smooths strands to protect against frizz and flyaways – but it also features a heavenly scent mix of patchouli, petitgrain and bergamot rind, so you’ll basically be able to forgo perfume for the day.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>KEVIN. MURPHY Hair Resort Beach Texturiser, $45.95 at Adore Beauty</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>For those with thicker wavy hair, this texturising lotion is a great option. It’s still pretty light, but provides a bit more hold than a mist. It also smells amazing, like coconuts and suntan oil.</p><h2 id=U811266186093PD>BEST CURL CREAMS FOR CURLY HAIR</h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>OUAI Hair Curl Crème, $49 at Sephora</a></b></p><p><b>What You Should Know:</b></p><p>Suitable for all curly hair types this curl cream from celebrity stylist Jen Atkin’s hair brand works to define natural curl texture while reducing frizz and adding shine.</p><p>The hydrating cream is silicone-free and scented with a gorgeous floral fragrance of bergamot, violet and white musk.</p><p>Five star reviews say it is “great for frizz prone” or dry hair, with one person writing: “Love this product! Works really well, not too strong that it makes your hair crunchy, but hold well and adds a nice texture to my hair.”</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Aveda Be Curly Curl Enhancing Lotion, $50 at THE ICONIC</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>One of my favourite curl creams for light hold and conditioning, this is honestly more of a gel consistency and has Aveda’s trademark scent, which is a lovely addition. A little goes a long way – don’t apply more than a 20 cent piece amount for long hair, likely less for short.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Evo Liquid Rollers, $40 at Adore Beauty</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>This cream is a little thicker than the Aveda and good for curls that can handle a bit more moisture. It’s great for wash and go styling in summer, as one reviewer on Adore Beauty says: “The product gives me the natural look I was after to avoid using hot tools.”</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Cake The Curl Friend Defining Curl Cream, $21.99 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>This cult curl cream has a legion of fans on Amazon, maintaining a 4.4 star rating and a whopping 5100 five-star reviews. One reviewer said it worked a treat for both her mum, who has short, curly hair, and for her long tresses. “I love that it’s not a super heavy/stick product and leaves my hair very soft and not crispy. It’s also quite moisturising which my very thirsty hair loves,” she added.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Organix Moroccan Perfection Curl Defining Cream, $53 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>Another top-rated curl product on Amazon, this cream has over 14,700 five-star reviews and holds a 4.4 star rating. Reviews are particularly good for those with frizz, with one person crediting the product for freeing her from bad hair days. “This product is a boon for people with frizzy wavy curly hair. Yes. My hair was all of the three before I started using this product. My hair was extremely frizzy, and curly on few days and wavy on few days and everyday was a bad hair day until I started using this curling cream.”</p><h2 id=U81126618609sD>BEST CURL CREAMS FOR TIGHT CURLS</h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Cantu Shea Butter for Natural Hair Coconut Curling Cream, $6.17 at iHerb</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>One of iHerb’s top-selling curl creams, this product provides a good dose of hydration for curly hair.</p><p>It promises to define curls without weighting down hair in the process and is also free of sulfates, silicones, parabens and phthalates.</p><p>“When my hair gets too dry during the day, it works as my saviour,” one five star review reads.</p><p>“I like the scent as well, it’s very delicate and light. Easy to apply and as opposed to hair oils, it doesn’t leave your hands greasy.”</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie, $21 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>Not only does this cream help enhance curls but it also smells great, according to reviews.</p><p>Containing organic shea butter, coconut oil and sweet hibiscus this hair “smoothie” works hard to reduce frizz, detangle and restore moisture.</p><p>With thousands of five star reviews on Amazon shoppers caution that a little goes a long way for this product.</p><p>“I only take a bit of this and rake it through my curly hair after a shower, since it’s thick and would weigh my short and thin hair down if I put a lot,” one five star reviewer wrote.</p><p>“It keeps my hair frizz-free and dry-free and helps with curl retention too. Great stuff for curly hair.”</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>ELEVEN Australia Keep Me Curl Defining Cream, $26.95 at Amazon Australia</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>This Australian-made cream will naturally define curls without that crunchy mousse-like feeling.</p><p>It contains hydrating and conditioning ingredients like Panthenol and Cyclopentasiloxane to help look after your curls and prevent frizz.</p><p>Five star reviews say it leaves you with “soft gorgeous curls”, with one shopper swearing they “cannot live without it”.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>MoroccanOil Curl Defining Cream, $57 at Sephora</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know:</b></p><p>This curl cream is so hydrating and moisturising, it’s like a hybrid between a treatment and a styling product. The smell is intense, but if you’re a fan of the signature Moroccanoil scent like me, you’ll adore it. “It doesn’t weigh my hair down or feel crunchy at all. Using it with a silk cap keeps my curls perfect for at least two days – highly recommend,” raved one reviewer.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Schwarzkopf Professional OSIS+ Curl Honey Curl Cream, $19.95 (down from $30) at Oz Hair and Beauty</a></b></p><p><b>What You Should Know:</b></p><p>As the name suggests, this curl cream is ultra softening and nourishing. With minimal hold but plenty of moisturising qualities, this is a great option for those who battle frizz in humid weather.</p><h2 id=U81126618609QQH>WHAT ARE THE FOUR TYPES OF HAIR?</h2><p>Hair types are often broken down into four categories. Type 1 is straight, type 2 is wavy, type 3 is curly and type 4 is tight curls and Afro-textured hair. These types can help dictate what products suit your hair best, as the higher your hair type, the more moisture it prefers. Curls are also classed in different categories under the Andre Walker Hair Typing System, with curls and waves across the 2, 3 and 4 categories of hair type then split into A-C types, depending on curl definition.</p><h2 id=U81126618609y8F>WHAT IS THE CURLY GIRL METHOD?</h2><p>Coined by author <a class=body-link href=# title=www.instagram.com rel=sponsored>Lorraine Massey</a> in her book <i>Curly Girl Hand Book</i> back in 2001, the Curly Girl Method is an approach to styling and caring for curly hair based on hair type. At its core, the Curly Girl Method is about keeping more porous hair types moisturised (curly hair types are often more porous), and in some cases avoiding shampoo entirely. It also eschews brushing or combing hair, and promotes using a diffuser attachment when blow-drying.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Want more hair content?
