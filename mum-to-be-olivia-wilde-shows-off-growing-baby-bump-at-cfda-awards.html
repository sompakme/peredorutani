(He uses the doll) as either a hammer or a baby."</p><p id=eZhJqtQcG5eN data-wc=89>In April, Olivia opened up about first meeting Jason, who popped the question in 2013. Speaking on the Howard Stern radio show, Olivia revealed that Jason used an enigmatic pick-up line when they first met backstage at a&nbsp;&nbsp;party in 2011. "He came up to me… right up in my face and said, 'Whatever you're looking for, you don't need it', and he walked away. "He didn't even try to pick me up, he just walked away. It was so mysterious, that's why I liked it."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
