Either way, though, it feels like if this doesn’t end in some kind of match, it’d be a dramatic waste of everyone’s time.</p><p>Beef on social media between wrestlers is hardly new but if we start to get into the territory whereby guys actually start fighting each other, it could get pretty interesting. This is probably just going to be a one-off, but you never know.</p><p>Janela seems to have the potential to go on and do some really big things with All Elite Wrestling, but in order to do so, he probably shouldn’t be wasting his time with spats like this on social media – although it does seem like the majority of fans are in his corner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49wZmpoX5q7u7uMmqSoqpVit7Cx2GahmqaVoa5us8StZKKmpKR6onnFop6hrF2WwW6uy6KlpGVhbX9ur86nmp6qpGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-omeprazole-make-osteoporosis-worse.html><span>←</span><span>Can omeprazole make osteoporosis worse?</span></a>
