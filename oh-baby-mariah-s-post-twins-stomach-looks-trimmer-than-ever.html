"I gained an enormous amount of weight. I was scared I was never going to walk again,"She told "I feel incredible but it was a long road.""Being pregnant felt longer than it was. It was a huge blessing to be able to have the babies but I felt trapped in my body because I couldn't move."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27168035f9ac-mariah-carey-2-z.jpg><p id=eLjjoJQlywcl data-wc=46>Mariah – who welcomed the new arrivals by Caesarean – had to wait six weeks to start on her exercise and diet programme, however. "At the beginning, I was breast feeding, so I had to eat more than I normally would. It was frustrating," she said.</p><p id=e35p7OrjvuCWK data-wc=112>Once she got started, the diva began with a 1500 calorie a day menu accompanied by workouts three times a week. "When I started, I got really strict with myself," she says. "Losing weight is about eating what you like, just in the appropriate portion sizes. I wouldn't say it was really hard, but it required focus and determination. "What kick started Mariah's weight loss journey was seeing a photo of herself shortly not long after being visited by friend Reverend Al Sharpton in hospital. "I looked at myself in the photo after and thought, 'Who on earth is that?' Mind you, I thought I looked good at the time!" She remembers.</p><p id=e10ic8SlRIod9w data-wc=49>Now the singer works out for 45 minutes five to six times a week, doing cardio and aquatic workouts, and gives herself a day off on Sundays. "Even thought my weight loss was mainly from dieting, I'm never going to stop working out. It releases stress," says the star.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
