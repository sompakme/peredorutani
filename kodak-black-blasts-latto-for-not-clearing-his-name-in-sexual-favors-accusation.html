What might be the most direct and confrontational of them all, though, might just be his new feud with Latto stemming from their collaboration on her 2022 album, 777. Moreover, for those unaware, she had confessed that it was difficult to get an artist (that she kept anonymous) on the album because they wanted sexual favors in order to clear it. Then, fans online assumed that the femcee was talking about Yak, and he just came through with another <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">response to the whole ordeal</a>. According to him, Latto failed to clear his name after Internet accusations went wild, but this brings us no closer to the actual truth.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Basically, the conversation stemmed when <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>N.O.R.E.</a> was doing his typical "this or that" questions to Kodak Black. When asked to pick between <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a> and Latto, he sided with the Bronx MC because of the aforementioned situation. Overall, it's a pretty difficult one to pin down, especially within the "he said, she said" framework that it falls under right now. However, this is far from the first time that Kodak has publicly addressed this issue.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kodak-black-goes-at-latto-on-drink-champs-watch>Kodak Black Goes At Latto On Drink Champs: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"This whole s**t looked like a damn plot," Kodak Black expressed during a rant back when Latto beat him out at the 2022 BET Hip-Hop Awards for "Song of the Year." "Then I look at the ‘gram like what shorty blocked me for? They probably hollerin’ at BET, like don’t give him that s**t. I told [people] weeks ago, 'Watch, they finna play with me and give it to frappuccino.'" On her end, the Atlanta-based hitmaker used that "frappuccino" title as <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a brief branding opportunity</a>, clearly showing her unfazed status in the public eye.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the Broward County rhymer denied that she referred to him with her comments about sexual advances, and made multiple other public statements against her. As such, this remains relatively one-sided. Whether the future will change that narrative anytime soon is up for us to witness- and to these artists to decide.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnZ4Z2gJZmoqickaB6o7jAnKJmpJGpwbB50p6vZp6VlsG2vsRmmqWdkad6r63MnmShoaBitbC8jKecsKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./everything-we-know-about-sela-vave-the-singer-spotted-holding-hands-with-jamie-foxx.html><span>←</span><span>Everything We Know About Sela Vave, the Singer Spotted Holding Hands with Jamie Foxx</span></a>
