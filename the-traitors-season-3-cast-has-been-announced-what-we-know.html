We are getting some people approach us, but also we want to think outside the box," he told the outlet. "The good thing about The Traitors is that I think we surprise people with some slightly different casting. I don’t think anyone would have expected John Bercow from the U.K. to be on season 2, but actually, he added his own thing to it. I think we have to try and do the same in season 3."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.youtube.com/vi/fP8NJxEjA9s/maxresdefault.jpg><p>However, the series likely won't lean on the same casting surprise they used for season 2 when season 1 contestant and Below Deck star Kate Chastain returned for a second round. When asked whether another former contestant could return for season 3, he told the outlet, "There’s a chance. I will say I also kind of think we did that with Kate. We brought Kate back, let’s try something new. I’d love to surprise people in a different way with a different casting twist of some sort."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOrZ%2BeZaSnrqrAzquqZquVlsCwuoxsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./should-i-keep-holding-dogecoin.html><span>←</span><span>Should I keep holding Dogecoin?</span></a>
