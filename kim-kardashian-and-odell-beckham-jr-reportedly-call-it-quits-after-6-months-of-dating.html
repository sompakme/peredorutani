Last month, they were spotted out in public for the first time at a luxury hotel ahead of the Super Bowl in Las Vegas. Later, they apparently labeled their relationship as exclusive.</p><p>Things seemed to be getting serious for the pair. Beckham Jr. had left the Baltimore Ravens and was supposedly considering moving to the Kansas City Chiefs to be a bit closer to Kardashian, who lives in L.A.

"All of us are having fun, and we have no marriage plans—yet,” Jenner told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/kris-jenner-kim-kardashian-kendall-jenner-have-no-plans-for-marriage-exclusive-8603541 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>People</a> at a charity event, referring to herself, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/kendall-jenner/>Kendall Jenner</a>, and Kardashian.</p><p>Kardashian and Beckham Jr. were last spotted together at the Vanity Fair <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/oscars/>Oscars</a> after party, where they briefly spoke on the red carpet. Soon after, Kardashian departed to Chateau Marmont for Jay-Z and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/beyonce/>Beyonce</a>'s post-Oscars party, and Beckham Jr. left soon after, supposedly to the same destination.</p><p>The news of this split is also making fans rethink Kardashian's recent Instagram post. The reality star shared a selfie with the cryptic caption, "Miss u." At the time, many assumed she was referring to her new flame, but now they wonder if this was a post-breakup hint.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gEKQ9BSmhQoV4wUn5ABXtc-1920-80.jpg><p>This isn't the only Instagram post getting a lot of attention at the moment. Kardashian is receiving criticism from fans for a recent post that featured a photo of herself and the caption, "On my way to find Kate."</p><p>Kardashian was referring to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/princess-catherine/>Kate Middleton</a> and the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/kensington-palace-kate-middleton-pr/>speculation surrounding her lack of appearances</a>. On Friday, the Princess of Wales announced that <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/kate-middleton-cancer/>she had been diagnosed with cancer</a> and was undergoing preventative chemotherapy. Since then, many have apologized for their jokes on the matter, including <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/blake-lively-photoshop-kate-middleton/>Blake Lively</a>, who <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/kim-kardashian-blake-lively-kate-middleton-photoshop-scandal/>referenced it in promotion</a> for her brands Betty Buzz and Betty Booze. Kardashian has yet to address the matter, despite the many comments urging her to apologize.</p><p>“After the news of her having cancer has been revealed, you should really take this down. It’s extremely insensitive and you owe our princess an apology,” one wrote.</p><p>“I think an apology is needed!” another individual posted. “Can you please go find an apology instead??”</p><p>“Didn’t age well. You never know what someone is battling,” one user commented.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGijmaJ6rK3RnZisoJmWu267w56jpWWSmrCstMCmZKOqXZe%2Fpq3KZqypZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./indiana-jones-5-release-date-cast-trailer-and-latest-news.html><span>←</span><span>Indiana Jones 5 | Release date, cast, trailer and latest news</span></a>
