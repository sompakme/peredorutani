It kept coming back to just a more stabilized schedule where I’m not in a different country every week,” the model shared. “[Guest In Residence] is very stabilizing. I have an office that I come to. I know everyone here. I don’t have to look a certain way to show up. It’s a different experience for me, and it was the right time because I was ready for that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hadid also expanded on what motherhood has looked like since welcoming her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>daughter Khai</a>, who she shares with ex Zayn Malik, back in September 2020, explaining that she’s the only one who sees the true Gigi.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“She obviously sees me in every state and way, and whether she knows it or not, I’m going through and learning through life with her,” Hadid said of their relationship. “I think that she has a really realistic kind of 24/7, around-the-clock view. We’re up chatting in the middle of the night if she’s up; we’re talking about, I don’t know, random stuff, but it’s fun.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The model continued, “Having a daughter, although it shifted my life to make me really want to feel more settled, has also really made me appreciate the chaos as well. Being at shows and shoots and just being in the city again; being around friends [after] becoming a mom, with everyone also coming out of COVID — I have an appreciation for both sides of it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xqKeomWYlrGqsIykn5qhXajBoq7IpaCznZRiwKS0xJ2spZ1dbH5yfI9waA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./do-coffee-grounds-decompose-in-a-septic-tank.html><span>←</span><span>Do coffee grounds decompose in a septic tank ?</span></a>
