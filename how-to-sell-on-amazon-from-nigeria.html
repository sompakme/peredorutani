Registration of an account</h3><p class=align-left>It is impossible to sell your products without an account on this platform. The good news is that you don’t have to travel from Nigeria to the USA to register such an account. At the same time, everything cannot be done online, from the comfort of your Nigerian home or office, because our country is not eligible to join the platform as sellers officially.</p><p class=align-left>There are some things you have to do first:</p><ul><li>Citizens of Niger, Namibia, and many other African countries can officially register at Amazon thus if you have a physical address (relatives, friends) in any of these African countries you can use it for your registration.</li><li>If you cannot work from Niger, Namibia or another supported country, you should find a U.S.-based partner that offers you a virtual physical address in the United States of America for rent.</li><li>Plus, you’ll need to have the internet connection, your documents ready (the account must be verified) and some of your time to register a non-USA seller account through a partner or with your friends/relatives help. You’ll also need to use VPN to hide your Nigerian IP-address during registration and platform usage</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/36e28c20a6aac75f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the usefulness of the UNN portal!</span></p></a><h4>Prices</h4><p class=align-left>Keep in mind that the seller account costs $39.99 plus extra selling fees per month, or it costs $0.99 plus extra fees per each item sold if you choose to create an individual seller account (it supports up to 40 items a month).</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Best online shopping sites that ship to Nigeria</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0c1d115f17e3cca9.jpg><h4>Details required to register</h4><p class=align-left>For the account registration you will need to use your real physical address (at the supported country only), real name, Mastercard/Visa international banking card along with the bank details (since you will need to be able to receive electronic payments and automatic wire transfers), etc.</p><p class=align-left><strong>P.S.</strong> Many Nigerians who wish to sell on Amazon directly from our country use international partners and a Payoneer prepaid card for receiving money in U.S. dollars and withdrawing them later in Nigeria in Naira.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> How to fund Payoneer MasterCard in Nigeria</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ac9076d79ce85db6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Amazon ship to Nigeria?</span></p></a><h3>2. Account approval</h3><p class=align-left>Once you have registered a seller account, you need to stay patient and wait for Amazon to activate and approve it.</p><p class=align-left>By the way, Amazon will ask for the EIN code to activate your account (it is used to clear your taxes in the USA once a year), and this number is obtained by you with the help of IRS.GOV website where you should fill out the special form called 10-BEN. Just write it down or print out and use when necessary.</p><h3>3. Choosing a shipping partner</h3><p class=align-left>In case of successful registration and account activation, you are highly advised to read all the guides created by Amazon for its network of sellers from all over the world.</p><p class=align-left>Now there are two ways you can choose to go:</p><ul><li>Ship your products to your partner who lives in the supported-for-seller-registration African countries.</li><li>Ship your products to Amazon warehouse through its FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) program.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/01d93fba58030170.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get a job in USA from Nigeria: useful tips for everyone</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The first option is not the best one because international shipping cost is expensive thus it scares away many potential buyers. Besides, it can take a long for your products to be shipped from African countries directly to your customers, many parcels can get lost on their way, and you might end up losing your money.</p><p class=align-left>The second option is more attractive to consumers from the USA because your products are physically located at the platform’s warehouse and they can be sold as a part of a ship-for-free program offered by Amazon, which can potentially earn you more money. Besides, if you are a part of the FBA program you won’t even have to ship each order separately because the company will do it for you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/70362d13b8133603.jpeg><h3>4. Amazon seller app</h3><p class=align-left>Once you have chosen how exactly you are planning to sell on Amazon, you should calculate the good prices for your products (with a nice profit) and start working on adding products to your Amazon store.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt35s7r1hell4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>An A to Z guide to Konga selling goods business</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Stay patient and believe in yourself. Download the mobile Amazon seller app and use it to control and manage your new online store.</p><p class=align-left>Choose to advertise if you wish to get noticed by the huge audience. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>, it has more than 95 million visitors per month from the USA only, also, it has millions of customers from all over the globe.</p><p class=align-left>If you have been asking, how can I sell on Amazon from Nigeria? While right now our country is not supported by this huge international platform and there are particular difficulties you have to go through if you really wish to offer your products to millions of customers from across the globe, it might one day change.</p><p class=align-left>Amazon is already working with many African countries directly allowing their residents to become sellers and use Amazon seller app on-the-go, so adding Nigeria to the list of these countries is probably just a matter of time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/998a6ecd5ba9cf4f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 work from home jobs in Nigeria you can do online</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Jumia seller registration in Nigeria: commission, SKU & support</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN8lmlocWWYpMRuv8Slo2aZnZbHsLqMp6CgnaKerm%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-anthony-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>George Anthony Net Worth 2024</span></a>
