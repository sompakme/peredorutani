"I don’t have those skin folds anymore—it was one of the best things I could have ever done for my self-confidence and it made me feel a lot better in my skin. So I just wanted to post about that just to clear up that rumor as to why I have a new look. I feel a lot better now about myself, and I’m so glad I had the blepharoplasty surgery. It was one of the greatest things I could’ve ever done."</p><p>Fans of Bynes were quick to flood the comments with their love and support.&nbsp;</p><p>“We miss the old Amanda because of nostalgia,” one TikTok user commented, “but we’re just happy you’re safe and happy and love yourself.”&nbsp;</p><p>“You are so important to so many of us,” another fan commented. “Thanks for entertaining us despite how difficult it was to be in show business so young. Glad you’re doing well.”</p><a title=@amandaamandaamanda1986 href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/@amandaamandaamanda1986 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@amandaamandaamanda1986</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Amanda B." href=# data-url=https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7311462113221118763 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>♬ original sound - Amanda B.</a><p>Bynes then went on to explain why she “usually doesn’t look good in paparazzi pictures.”&nbsp;</p><p>“That’s because paparazzi pictures are taken outside and the sunlight is usually really harsh and bright on my skin,” she explained. “And also, I have scars on the right side of my face that you can’t really tell if you don’t see it in, like, a certain bright light.”&nbsp;</p><p>Bynes then took her viewers outside to see how lighting changes her appearance—an explanation Bynes owned no one, to be sure—at one point saying without skipping a beat: “Like here, this lighting is not good on me. I look pretty goofy, but whatever.”&nbsp;</p><p>I, for one, am here for Bynes’ “whatever” attitude when it comes to negative comments regarding her appearance. As a child actress who came of age at a time when the likes of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a35459643/framing-britney-spears-directors-interview/><u>Britney Spears,</u></a> Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera and Mandy Moore were at the mercy of an unforgiving (and frankly sexist) society hellbent on nit-picking every single thing about their appearance, romantic relationships and public friendships, to see Bynes embracing her appearance with a “I don't care” attitude is refreshing.&nbsp;</p><p>Bynes seems to be feeling the love, too. “Thank you so much for the support,” she said at the end of one of her TikTok videos. “ I love you all and hope you all have a beautiful night.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiZnZa7pa2Mm7CnnaNiu6bDjKWmqKNf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abbey-wilson-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Abbey Wilson Net Worth 2024</span></a>
