In all, it spans some 12 miles.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The base is safe from radioactivity as it was never put into action</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alamy</span></figure><p>The largest cave is where the nuclear reaction hall was planned, and is almost 80 metres high and 25 wide.</p><p>Built in 1966 when Chinese relations with the Soviet Union began to decline, the bunker in the mountains of Chongqing in the Fuling district was designed to withstand thousands of tons of explosives as well as 8-magnitude earthquakes. More than 60,000 soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army helped construct the plant, with at least 100 dying in the process.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The bunker underwent renovations before opening for foreign tourists</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alamy</span></figure><p>The project was on-going for 17 years before it was abandoned in a nearly finished state in 1984 when the Cold War began to thaw. Thankfully for the visiting public, it was shut down before the manufacture of plutonium-239 began. 816 was declassified in 2002 and opened to Chinese nationals in 2010, but now, after a renovation, foreign tourists are also allowed to visit.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Its tunnels are wide enough for cars to drive through</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alamy</span></figure><p>"The site is now open to foreign visitors and will allow overseas partners," said Yang Yan, an administrator at the site told <a href=#>China Daily</a>. "So far, no foreigners have visited the plant."</p><p>"This base has never been put into operation or stored any nuclear material," Yang said. "There is no need to worry about radiation. It is safe to enter."</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Former assistant manager of the plant Zhang Xiaodong talks to guests</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Alamy</span></figure><p>"A tour takes three hours," Yang said. "Visitors must follow the guide; otherwise they will get lost in this huge maze-like cave."</p><p>China was initially friendly with the Soviet Union, seeing the communist state as one of its greatest allies, but in the wake of the Second World War relations suffered as the political ideologies of the two diverged. In 1961 the Communist Part of China formally denounced the Soviet variety of communism as a product of "Revisionist Traitors".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6dnKysmaOutbXOp6pomaOernCvx6KlmmeRp8Gqr8ueqmibmJ67onnOqZynq12svLO4w6xkpZminLK0wIyupZ2dopy%2FsMHNnWSnrZOhsqK%2BjJusp6OVp3p5fZVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./huck-seed-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Huck Seed Net Worth</span></a>
