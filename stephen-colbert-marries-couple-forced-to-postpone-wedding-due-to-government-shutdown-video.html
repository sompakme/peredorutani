I have been dieting for like 15 minutes. … You’re gonna be fine, you’re gonna be great, but it doesn’t matter because everyone’s going to be looking at me, OK?”</p><p>Le ultimately agreed to go forward with the ceremony and Colbert married the couple&nbsp;on his show.</p><p>The wedding also featured special appearances from <strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong>, who offered a “nondenominational Jewish blessing” for the couple, and <strong>Audra McDonald</strong>, who performed a ballad version of <strong>Billy Idol</strong>‘s “White Wedding” for the couple’s first dance, a comedically inappropriate choice.</p><p>Colbert even got national park icon Smokey the Bear to stand in for the best man, who was unavailable to attend.</p><p>Watch the full wedding celebration below.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrKueqJiau26vzqWZnqqkYrqivtGinKxlk6TCsbjEZp2oqpOasW6Ck2xqcXBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-gosling-gives-sweet-public-shout-out-to-eva-mendes-and-daughters-during-star-studded-snl-appear.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Gosling gives sweet public shout-out to Eva Mendes and daughters during star-studded SNL appear</span></a>
