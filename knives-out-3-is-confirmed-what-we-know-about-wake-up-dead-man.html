Below, we're keeping track of everything we know about the third Knives Out film so far.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The next Benoit Blanc mystery, the follow-up to Knives Out and Glass Onion, is called Wake Up Dead Man. pic.twitter.com/pdDXRDmwcI<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1794005920898502741 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>May 24, 2024</a></p><h2 id=when-will-39-knives-out-39-3-be-released-3>When will 'Knives Out' 3 be released?</h2><p>On May 24, 2024, Johnson and Netflix announced that the third Knives Out film, Wake Up Dead Man, will arrive on the streaming giant in <strong>2025</strong>. The director gave the news via a motion-art teaser shared on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://x.com/rianjohnson/status/1794005920898502741 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>X</a> (formerly Twitter) where the new title is paired with an ominous black casket.

Johnson paired the news with a first-look image of Benoit Blanc; in the black-and-white pic, the detective has noticeably longer, perhaps even blonder hair while standing on a soundstage.</p><p>"Aaaaand we’re off! Today is day 1 of shooting on the next Benoit Blanc mystery 'Wake Up Dead Man' - see you on the other side," Johnson wrote in a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://x.com/rianjohnson/status/1800166308321104341 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) about the news.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvJdGBHYxavzFP6GsFyE5a-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=who-has-been-cast-in-39-knives-out-39-3-3>Who has been cast in 'Knives Out' 3?</h2><p>After weeks of near-constant cast announcements, we finally have our full roster for the third Knives Out ensemble!

Then, behold, the glass was shattered. But my most dangerous case yet is about to be revealed."</p><p>So allow your imagination to run wild over the next year before the film's 2025.
