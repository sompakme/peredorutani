Per the outlet, her home is listed at a median price of $190,000, which she shares with her husband and their three children; other avenues of income could feasibly be attributed to book sales the former press secretary made from her memoir "Speaking for Myself: Faith, Freedom, and the Fight of Our Lives Inside the Trump White House,"&nbsp;which was published in September 2020. (Though it is unclear how much Sanders has made in royalties and book sales, the autobiography placed on the bestseller lists for The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, The Wall Street Journal, and others, per <a href=# rel=sponsored class=norewrite>Amazon</a>.)</p><p>Other facets contributing to Sanders' net worth could also possibly be her annual income during her time in the White House as an aide, which lasted from 2017 until 2019.&nbsp;As <a href=#>NJ.com</a> reported in 2018, Sanders made roughly $179,000 per year as press secretary, which included a $14,700 salary bump compared to her original predecessor, Sean Spicer.</p><p>But could there be more to her wealth than meets the eye? And could it have something to do with the Huckabee family name, which Sanders used exclusively before her marriage to her <a href=#>husband, Bryan Sanders</a>, in 2010?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHFoZ4Nxe8eormarkaeuqXnHrpqkmZKasm6%2FwKebnqqjYr%2BmrculsGalkaCytHnHnqlmpZ%2Bjsrp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-does-it-cost-to-have-a-plumber-install-a-water-pressure-regulator.html><span>←</span><span>How much does it cost to have a plumber install a water pressure regulator?</span></a>
