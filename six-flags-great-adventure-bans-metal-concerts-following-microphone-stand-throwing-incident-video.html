Radke injured two fans in the audience after hurling three microphone stands off the stage.</p><p>In a video captured by a fan on Youtube, Radke is performing shirtless for the band’s final song of their headlining set, “The Drug in Me Is You.” &nbsp;It is unclear what motivated Radke to toss the microphone stands into the crowd, as the crowd seemed well behaved and his band was&nbsp;in good spirits after a sweaty show. The singer finished with a simple, “Thank you! Good Night!”</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: iHeartRadio Festival Features a Green Day On-Stage Meltdown</strong></a></p><p>Radke’s actions injured two&nbsp;guests at the New Jersey show’s “FestEVIL,” which featured 20 punk, metal, and hardcore bands. The victims included a 16-year-old girl, who suffered a two- to three-inch cut on the top of her head and bruising on her forehead, police said. She was taken to CentraState Medical Center in Freehold Township for treatment. The other victim, a 24-year-old man, was treated at the scene.</p><p>After the incident&nbsp;, local&nbsp;authorities charged the 28-year-old singer of Glendale, Calif., with simple assault and aggravated assault. He was released on $25,000 bail.</p><p>“This was the first metal show that we’ve ever had, and will be the last,”&nbsp; Kristin Siebeneicher, spokeswoman for the Jackson-based theme park, told the Asbury Park Press. “We have no plans to host another metal show.”</p><p>“This performer was completely reckless,” said Siebeneicher. “He had complete disregard for the safety of his fans. His actions were totally unacceptable. It’s not the type of entertainment that we want to be producing.”</p><p>The event, which attracted 1,000 people, &nbsp;took place in the theme park’s Northern Star Area.</p><p>Falling in Reverse is signed to Epitath Records. Their 2011 CD, The Drug in Me Is You, charted at number 19 on the Billboard charts, selling 18,000 copies in its first week. The band’s songs include, “I’m Not A Vampire,” “Good Girls, Bad Guys,” and “Raised By Wolves.”</p><p>This isn’t Radke’s first brush with the law.&nbsp; According to the website, Loudwire.com, he was sentenced to five years probation on battery charges in connection with his role in the 2006 fatal shooting of an 18-year-old man in Nevada. He did not shoot the man, but spent close to three&nbsp;years in prison after violating his probation. The songs for the album “The Drug in Me Is You” were all written by Radke during his imprisonment.</p><p>Watch Radke toss the mics after performing “The Drug in Me Is You”:</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2Botrl5xaWYoKtdnL%2BmrdNmmJ2ulaPBtr7EZpmapl2isrWty2aaqKaTmr%2B1v4xsbm9oY2h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-cydney-christine-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-rumours-an.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Cydney Christine Dating Now?
