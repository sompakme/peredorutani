"Most of us, when it comes to eating healthy, think about a bowl of salad with grilled chicken. But is it enough to reach your goals? Definitely not. Unknown to most people, one of the biggest reasons they don't get results they aim for, is simply NOT eating enough."</span></span></p><p id=ec7ZgLfVQicP data-wc=11><strong><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY: Marvin Humes' trainer reveals how to shape up for Christmas</a></strong></p><p id=ecf4QOWCZ2Tu><span style=background:#fff><span style=color:#000></span></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/20c4b670efb5-nessasphere-before-and-after-a.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e_mriur7aUcP data-wc=11><span style=background:#fff><span style=color:#000><strong>Nessa said she saw more results when she started eating more</strong></span></span></p><p id=e69PDXmuv8yZ data-wc=102><span style=background:#fff><span style=color:#000>Nessa explained that when you're not eating enough, your body can go into starvation mode and your metabolism slows down. And it can cause long term physical and mental damage to your body. "This kind of plateau can push some people to eating less and at the end it leads to real problems you can't recover easily from. There are many physical actions your body takes when you're not eating enough calories but there are also mental ones," Nessa wrote. "Eating less usually means feeling frustrated, you're hungry, you lose your motivation and simply give up. Is it what you really want?"</span></span></p><p id=eMGR1SAhFvnU><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Get healthy eating inspiration here</a></p><p id=en8XmHSUm5Mg data-wc=75><span style=background:#fff><span style=color:#000>The 40-year-old, who has transformed her body through a healthy diet and regular exercise, said she first started to see results when she ate five or six well balanced meals a day, consuming around 2,000 to 2,200 calories. "I exercise at least 5 times a week usually before heading to work. I turned on my metabolism, I constantly progress, I look leaner although I gained weight, I am stronger and I feel great," she said.</span></span></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p style=text-align:center id=eaUT8DgGmB4O data-wc=6><strong>An example of Nessa's daily diet</strong></p><p id=eoXtjtSmNMDP data-wc=62><span style=background:#fff><span style=color:#000>"My body knows it gets healthy food every 3 hours and do not need to conserve energy. Building muscle, weight loss or body recomposition is a patience game. It takes time and consistency to make it work." Nessa concluded: "Don't skip meals, make food your friend not your enemy and remember, eating more is the key to losing more and looking better."</span></span></p><p id=elcW0i9EiaRP data-wc=4><strong><span style=background:#fff><span style=color:#000>See the latest <a class=hm-link href=#>health and fitness stories</a> here.</span></span></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
