"I was on Live the other day saying 'I'm not on&nbsp;Donda.' I don't think Ye wanted me on&nbsp;Donda.&nbsp;That's cool. Conway and West on there, if they're on there everybody knows that I'm on there, cause that's the gang. I'ma still fly that flag.&nbsp;Do it look like I'm left off Bad And Boujee&nbsp;type shit. If the homies on there, I'm on there. It's the same flag."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/16/44/904416_695a60cc2c0437d77b0ff4c9149fdd43.jpg><p><h6>&nbsp;Aaron J. Thornton/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Adam jokes that Benny might be a little bit too OVO-related for Kanye to fully endorse, prompting Benny to speculate on whether or not the ongoing rift between Ye and Drake may have impacted his bag. "I don't think so, I think those dudes are mature," he states. "They know that it's a business and guys who they fuck with are going to work with guys they don't fuck with. They understand that. I don't take none of this shit personal."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Without wasting time, Adam inquires if we're ever going to hear <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the long-awaited Drake feature</a>. "Yes we are," says Benny. "He hit me the other day and said 'let's drop it as a freestyle'. I know he's&nbsp;doing shit and working on his album. Same thing with me. He's just trying to pick the right spot cause it's something he and I want to do. It's about picking the right spot."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/85/90/329085_5150bd8057ac7c9b1fb204e196be8017.jpg><p><h6>Prince Williams/Wireimage/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"We obliterated it," teases Benny, after Adam wonders whether or not the pair have simply fallen out of love with the song. "We're just trying to pick the right spot. "He has been sitting down for a while. He wants to put an album out. He just trying to pick a spot." Adam agrees that releasing new music before the big album release might shatter immersion, referring to the pre-Drake-release as "the calm before the storm."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Shortly afterward, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Benny speaks on his relationship with JAY-Z</a>, who he refers to as a mentor. "He just trying to steer me in the right direction," explains Benny. "He accepts the responsibility of showing our generation how to do it. A lot of dudes don't, they are too busy being competitive with us." He explains that JAY-Z and the entire team at Roc Nation continue to show interest in his career, prompting Adam to ask how Hov feels about the Drake feature.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"He's excited about it because it will put me in a better position," says Benny. "He's one of the first people I played it for. It's JAY, he don't take that [rivalry] personally. He gon' be him. None of these n***as can hold a candle to that guy."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For more from Benny, check out the full interview below, courtesy of No Jumper.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>WATCH: </strong>Benny The Butcher & Rick Hyde hit No Jumper</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
