The R.I.P. singer, who recently <a class=hm-link href=#>broke up with her DJ boyfriend</a> <a class=hm-link href=#>Calvin Harris</a>, shared a photo of her new inking on <strong>Twitter and Instagram</strong>. Rita, 23, revealed that the intricate design had been free drawn onto her arm before being made permanent.</p><p id=e-yMv5z4qrq6 data-wc=80>"We're gona be ballerinas when were 102! @andacloud9 #iloveubestie @bangbangnyc free-hand drawn on. You beast! Love you my brother!" wrote Rita next to the black-and-white snap. The chart-topper seemed more than happy with the result as she posted another photo of the etching. "Undercut Massive...with my little ballerina @yaro___," she captioned it, showing off the&nbsp;inking from another angle. The mastermind behind Rita's latest&nbsp;body art&nbsp;was her close friend, <strong>tattoo artist Bang Bang</strong>, whose real name is Keith McCurdy.</p><p id=eJYn2t9_lFN- data-wc=35>The celebrity artist – who has <a class=hm-link href=#>inked various stars</a> including Justin Bieber, Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn – shared a photo of Rita lying down in the comfort of her hotel room, about to go under the needle.</p><p id=e1za_3OpbnCw data-wc=65>While Summer singer Calvin, 30, announced the <a class=hm-link href=#>end of his relationship</a> with Rita on Twitter, the blonde beauty did not immediately respond to his post. "To address speculation - myself and Rita ended our relationship some time ago," he wrote. "She is a beautiful, talented woman & I wish her all the best." Recent reports have suggested that this was the <strong>first time Rita had heard of their split</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ba0fa0d488db-rita3-z.jpg><p id=e_cSOqYVvrjw data-wc=5><strong>Rita Ora and Calvin Harris</strong></p><p id=e_Y3mcsoQEGD data-wc=95>"I don't usually address speculation but <strong>I've had an incredible time w Calvin</strong>, & I will treasure the memories," she posted, breaking her silence for the first time. "I've moved on from this topic so I hope people will respect that and do the same," she added. Rita, who has previously admitted that Calvin "got something out of [her] that [she] never thought [she] had. Yes, like <a class=hm-link href=#>falling in love</a>," started dating the DJ in <strong>May 2013</strong>. It is thought the couple started to drift a few months ago when Calvin was seen partying with other women.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbWdvaWJmhnR%2BmGipoqyRYryzrYytmK2sn6R6qrrSrZigqpGieqSty6%2Bgp2WYlr%2BztdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miz-cracker-age-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Miz Cracker Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Weight, Net Worth in 2021 and more</span></a>
