Boxcars are known to have been pushed off ferries at the time to lighten the vessels’ loads during storms to stop them sinking.</p><p>It’s believed the gold may have been looted from the Confederate treasury during the capture of Jefferson Davis in 1865, and then transported — possibly by Colonel Robert Horatio George Minty —&nbsp;to Michigan after previously being buried in Lincoln County, Georgia.</p><p>Dkystra has previously told how a piece of Confederate gold that turned up in Traverse City, Michigan — coincidentally where Marty Lagina’s oil and gas business operates from — was examined by three experts who said it “could only have come from the Confederate gold that was taken down in Lincoln County, Georgia.”</p><p>Dykstra added: “I know the gold is out there in Lake Michigan waiting to be found.”</p><p></p><p>Dykstra’s treasure-hunting partner Frederick J. Monroe told local television station WWZM13&nbsp;in 2015 how he first heard about the apparent treasure in 1972.</p><p>He said: “I was sitting down and talking to a friend of mine, and all of the sudden he says, ‘Fred, you’re just the person I want to see with your diving experience,</p><p>“My grandfather told me a story that he heard from a lighthouse keeper, who originally heard it during a deathbed confession, that there’s 2 million dollars of gold bullion inside a boxcar that fell off a ferry into Lake Michigan.”</p><p>Dykstra and Monroe later found out that the deathbed confession was made by a man called George Alexander Abbott, who was a prominent banker before he died in Michigan in 1921 and also Colonel Minty’s brother-in-law. Abbott’s sister Grace Ann Abbott was married to Colonel Minty.</p><p>Dykstra has previously revealed how during a past search for the boxcar he and his team uncovered a coal car in the bottom of Lake Michigan.</p><p>Then in April 2015, Dykstra and Monroe uncovered a shipwrecked 70ft tug boat near the city of Frankfort — with a safe inside.</p><p>They said at the time that they believed the discovery boost the theory about the boxcar containing gold bullion, because Monroe had also been told a story about a sunken boat that had a safe on board containing jewellery, gold and silver.</p><p></p><h2>When does The Curse of Civil War Gold premiere?</h2><p>According to the trailer, the new series will premiere on March 6 at 10/9c on History. That is the same night and immediately after <a href=#>The Curse of Oak Island Season 5 finale</a>.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Michigan Live</a>, History were in the state filming for the new series in October.&nbsp;The Curse of Civil War Gold is believed to be being produced by Prometheus Entertainment, the same production company behind The Curse of Oak Island.</p><p>The tagline on the trailer reads: “From the producers of The Curse of Oak Island comes…the next big search.”</p><p>The Curse of Civil War Gold premieres Tuesday, March 6, at 10/9c on History.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWismJp6pMHRrJxmp5ZisKrCyKVksJmiYrSwuMNmpZ6vXam%2Fpq3SrqmeZZiqu7W1zaBkrKCfrHqwuoyhoKysn6fGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./terry-fator-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Terry Fator Net Worth 2024</span></a>
