The most complex puzzles in Hogwarts Legacy are the ones you will come across in the game's main story, in particular during the first and the second trial.&nbsp;</p><p>In the second trial, also known as Charles Rookwood's trial, there are two main Archway puzzles that are a bit tricky to overcome. If you're struggling with these, fret not. Here's our guide explaining how to solve Charles Rookwood's trial puzzles in Hogwarts Legacy.</p><pre>REMINDER - Hogwarts Legacy was due to launch on <a href=# rel=noopener>PS4 and Xbox One</a> on April 4, but now won't release until <strong>5 May 2023.</strong></pre><h2>Table of Contents</h2><p></p><h2 id=mcetoc_1gsvt1pl32>Blocking Pillar Puzzle Solution In Charles Rookwood's Trial</h2><p>Your first big obstacle in Charles Rookwood's trial is the blocking pillar in front of the Archway. The Archway, like in the <a href=#>Percival Rackham trial</a>, functions as a parallel world from which you can pull platforms and other objects. This time around, however, the Archway can be rotated by casting magic on these circular pedals on the walls.&nbsp;</p><p>Use the ancient magic pool and cast magic on the pedal on the right to rotate the Archway. Now, cast Accio through the Archway on the pillar, which is now a box, and pull it to your side. With the pillar removed, cast again on the pedal and the path ahead should open up. Walk through the Archway to proceed to the next room.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/pG6zLO4HgNiocuCSy5eCprtf7l8S7G1BBO1wXSl-YMU/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9ob2d3YXJ0c19sZWdhY3kvY2hhcmxlc3Jvb2t3b29kdHJpYWwvY2hhcmxlc3Jvb2t3b29kdHJpYWxwdXp6bGVzb2x1dGlvbi0yLmpwZw><h2 id=mcetoc_1gsvt1pl33>Bridge Puzzle Solution In Charles Rookwood's Trial</h2><p>The second most challenging puzzle in Charles Rookwood's trial is the Bridge puzzle. It's right before the final boss battle, so fret not. You're nearly out of here.&nbsp;<br>Once you have arrived, you will notice one-half of a bridge passing through the Archway. You need to find a way to climb the bridge, make it whole, and walk through the Archway to reach the other side.&nbsp;</p><p>Activate the ancient magic pool and cast magic on the pedal. The Archway will rotate, and that part of the bridge will move toward you. Now, stand between the Archway, and you will notice a box on the other side. Cast Accio to pull the box through the Archway and onto your side.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/wKycahLYhqUm_ZtbxwL8R2s1AZvlpsYWctIkl5R4F20/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9ob2d3YXJ0c19sZWdhY3kvY2hhcmxlc3Jvb2t3b29kdHJpYWwvY2hhcmxlc3Jvb2t3b29kdHJpYWxwdXp6bGVzb2x1dGlvbi0zLmpwZw><p>Place the box between the two staircases in such a way that it's now right under the bridge. Now walk through the other side of the Archway to convert the box into a climbable pillar. Use it to reach this side of the bridge. Cast magic again on the pedal to rotate the Archway and bring the other side of the bridge. Use the Archway to reach the next room.</p><p>And that's it!
