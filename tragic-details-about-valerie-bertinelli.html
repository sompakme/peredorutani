Wolfgang played as Van Halen's bassist in the early days of his career before starting his own band, Mammoth WVH. The rock band was nominated for a 2022 Grammy for their song "Distance," which pays tribute to Eddie Van Halen, per <a href=#>Variety</a>. Wolfgang spoke with the publication about his reaction to seeing the song's music video for the first time. "I wanted to show what an amazing father he was, and not just the guitar player everyone thought," he said. "I remember the first time watching it with my girlfriend, I was sobbing so much I had to hand her the phone."</p><p dir=ltr>Luckily, Wolfgang seems to have a strong support system around him. Aside from his girlfriend, Bertinelli has been with him as well, and she shared they're mourning Eddie's death together. "We're doing okay. We spent the holidays together. I'll see him later today. We've been spending a lot of time together," she said in an interview on "<a href=#>Today</a>." While they seem to have always had a close bond — Bertinelli's Instagram handle, @wolfiesmom, acknowledges how proud she is to be his mother — working through this hard time appears to have solidified their relationship even more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG1jbIN2e9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjK%2BYpZ2inrJursSrq6KmlaG5qns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-navaid-rashid-death-who-is-tony-navaid-rashid-tony.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Navaid Rashid Death, Who Is Tony Navaid Rashid?
