He said that Vince McMahon threw out a “what if” kind of thing instead of seriously pitching the angle of being the father of Stephanie’s baby.</p><p>”He did not want to run an incest angle, he asked a question one time – what if he was the father? That’s it. This is coming from people who never had a creative bone in their body.”</p><p>Conrad Thompson asked if Shane McMahon was pitched to be the father of Stephanie and Triple H’s baby, Prichard denied that as well. “It just didn’t happen because if it did happen, it’d be a joke.”</p><p>If Vince McMahon suggested that he become the father of his own grandchild, then it was a joke. We can only imagine how things would have played out if Stephanie McMahon said she was okay with the angle. Thankfully, Steph declined the idea.</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me.
