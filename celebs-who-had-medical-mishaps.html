Per <a href=#>Maloney Law Group</a>, the John Hopkins University School of Medicine conducted a study on the phenomenon and found that medical malpractice led to the deaths of between 250,000 and 440,000 Americans annually.</p><p dir=ltr>For his part, Travis Barker has claimed to have fallen victim to a medical error, and even filed a lawsuit in his own defense in 2018. According to court docs obtained by <a href=#>TMZ</a>,&nbsp;the drummer sued the hospital that treated him for blood clots, alleging that a doctor had used a dirty needle while sedating him prior to an MRI, which resulted in a staph infection. Barker was then unable to play with his band, Blink-182, for several shows, leading to the cancellation some shows entirely that fall and delaying the start of Blink's residency in Las Vegas.</p><p>Though Barker hasn't updated fans on the status of his lawsuit since, in the summer of 2022, he did have another serious health scare following a routine endoscopy, which resulted in severe abdominal pain and a hospitalization. Per <a href=#>NBC 4</a>, Barker later shared on his Instagram story, "During the endoscopy, I had a very small polyp removed right in a very sensitive area, usually handled by specialists, which unfortunately damaged a critical pancreatic drainage tube. This resulted in severe life threatening pancreatitis." Thankfully, Barker's condition improved, and he was able to return home a few days later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamllZoJxhI6cnKWdkqh6uLTOZp%2BanF2isqW1wpqjZqWZqLWivNJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angela-stanton-king-backtracks-after-taunting-tamar-braxton-with-photo-of-herself-and-jeremy-robinso.html><span>←</span><span>Angela Stanton-King Backtracks After Taunting Tamar Braxton With Photo Of Herself And Jeremy Robinso</span></a>
