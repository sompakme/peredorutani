Luckily, there is no shortage of the <a href=#>Wednesday</a> star, with fans most recently getting a glimpse at the actresses posing in a stunning black dress for the cover of The Sunday Times Style. In a photo recently posted to <a href=#>Instagram</a>, fans get to see the actress donning a sleek, stylish look.&nbsp;</p><p>The stunning black and white photo shows Jenna Ortega posing on a concrete rooftop, leaning back on her hands to show off the dress’s plunging neckline. Sheer cutouts on the side give viewers a peek at the starlet’s midriff. Elegant black plumes hang off the skirt of the skin-tight dress.&nbsp;</p><p>In the photo, Jenna Ortega is wearing vintage Mary Jane shoes with long white stockings pushed down around her ankles, showing off the <a href=#>Scream</a> actress’s sleek legs. The look allows fans to see the star in a different light than her character Tara Carpenter on Scream VI. The photo gives off a sophisticated elegance while not being too serious, and Jenna Ortega is pulling it off perfectly.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress, who is perhaps best known for her role on the hit <a href=#>Netflix</a> series Wednesday, has had a long acting career. She got her first role when she was just 10 years old and appeared on the American sitcom Rob for a single episode. Since then, Jenna Ortega’s fame has reached new heights. The actress has also appeared in hit films like The Fallout, X, and popular tv series such as <a href=#>You</a>.</p><p>Of course, her breakout role came with <a href=#>Tim Burton’s</a> Wednesday, where fans fell in love with the actress’s deadpan portrayal of Wednesday Addams. The series launched her career to a new height, and now everyone is talking about her. However, the actress, who is only 20 years old, has spoken out in interviews in the past about her relationship with the limelight.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/scream-5-jenna-ortega-phone-900x506.jpg><p>Jenna Ortega is a quiet introvert, and while acting is what fuels her passion, the networking side of the profession can get her feeling a bit stuck. The star wanted to be an actor since she was just six years old and now has a career that spans 10 years. Even though the actress recently became a household name, she has noted in the past that none of that matters.</p><p>Her biggest passion lies in making movies, acting, and writing, but for her, the fame and fortune that comes with being an international sensation are not necessary. Even working on a small scale is enough for the titular Wednesday star. While she comes across as a natural on screen, filming promos and hitting the red carpet makes her feel out of place.&nbsp;</p><p>After seeing her riveting performance as Tara on Scream VI, that can be hard for many fans to believe. The actress claims to keep a small circle of close friends, many of which are fellow cast and crew members from her performances. Fans can look forward to seeing the actress in a few <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=upcoming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>upcoming</a> performances, including Winter, Spring, Summer, or Fall and Miller’s Girl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnmpq7r62MqKmtnZeWerS0zrBkqJ6WYrmms9Jnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sarah-paulson-and-ariana-debose-talk-fashion-and-red-carpet-wins.html><span>←</span><span>Sarah Paulson and Ariana DeBose Talk Fashion and Red Carpet Wins</span></a>
