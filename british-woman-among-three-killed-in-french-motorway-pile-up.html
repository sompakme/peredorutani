She was young and healthy and full of the spirit of life. I loved her so much.”</p><p>Two of her daughters and their father were taken to hospital following the crash, it is understood.</p><p>A total of 17 people were killed or injured in the three-vehicle collision on the A26 motorway south of Lens, which happened at around 6pm on Sunday, according to local authorities. Several children were among the injured.</p><p>“Seventeen people are currently reported to have been involved in the crash. Three people died, five are in a life-threatening condition, three are in a serious condition and another six were involved,” the Pas-de-Calais state prefecture said in a statement.</p><p>“This accident took place between three vehicles – two cars and a British nine-seater family vehicle.”</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Roadworks taking place</h2><p>Citing regional sources, La Voix du Nord, a local newspaper, reported: “A 40-year-old British woman died instantly, along with two others travelling in another vehicle. The other passengers, aged between six and 48, were taken to hospital in Cambrai and Arras.”</p><p>The accident happened on a section of the motorway where roadworks were taking place, between the towns of Neuville-Saint-Vaast and Thelus.</p><p>A second vehicle contained four people, a 75-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man, who also died. The other two passengers in this car were a 14-year-old boy and a 79-year-old man, who were reported to be in a critical condition. They were transported by helicopter to hospitals in Lille and Arras, according to La Voix du Nord.</p><p>The third vehicle involved was a car with four passengers, including three children, aged between six and 33. They suffered light injuries. Eight “minors” were involved in the crash, according to the Pas-de-Calais prefecture.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Witnesses offered counselling</h2><p>Jacques Billant, the regional state prefect, thanked emergency services and advised motorists to respect road safety. He said they should check vehicles, including oil and tyre pressure, before setting out, check traffic and weather conditions for the entire journey; avoid drowsiness at the wheel by making regular stops, and remain focused.</p><p>The case is being handled by the Arras prosecutor’s office. The section of the A26 motorway was closed off until late into the night on Saturday as six emergency medical teams attended the scene.</p><p>Around 60 firefighters were dispatched to the crash scene to try to rescue the victims. The motorway was re-opened early on Monday morning.</p><p>Witnesses of the horrific crash were being offered psychological counselling. An investigation has been launched to try and determine the cause of the accident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaK%2Bfp7mlec2erqxnYmV%2FdHuPcGZsaV%2BXv6rAyKyfZq%2Bfoq6vecOemJ1lk5a%2Fbq%2FRmqqhZZOkua210qKmp2Wcmru0ecWrmKeblWK6sMDOq66asV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alineaci%C3%B3n-titular-confirmada-de-colombia-vs-venezuela-el-primer-once-de-lorenzo-en-eliminatorias.html><span>←</span><span>Alineacin titular confirmada de Colombia vs Venezuela: el primer once de Lorenzo en Eliminatorias</span></a>
