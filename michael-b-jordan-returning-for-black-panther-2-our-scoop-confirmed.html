Tasked with the impossible, the creative team developed a script worthy of King T’Challa’s legacy. Two months ago, Giant Freakin Robot learned from a trusted and proven inside source that Michael B. Jordan will be reprising his role as <a href=#>Killmonger</a> in&nbsp;Black Panther 2. Now, a new report from <a href=#>ScreenGeek</a> confirms our report. They’ve also learned that Michael B. Jordan will be in the Black Panther sequel.</p><p>Although Michael B. Jordan’s character died at the end of 2018’s&nbsp;Black Panther, his return was always on the cards. After all, it’s pretty much an unspoken rule that bad guys can always make a comeback. Interestingly, their report adds a new detail. They’ve heard that Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan’s character) will return in the Ancestral Plane, serving as a mentor to a young hero. They weren’t sure who that hero would be, though they speculated that it could be Shuri, played by Letitia Wright.</p><p>Previously, Michael B. Jordan has expressed interest in reprising his role for&nbsp;Black Panther 2. Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>&nbsp;in May, The actor said he loves those characters and Erik definitely means a lot to him. So if the timing is right and if the story is meaningful, he would love to be part of that journey. At the time Michael B. Jordan said that he’s wasn’t sure what Ryan Coogler was doing with the film. But he has no doubt that he’ll work with him again – even if he doesn’t return as Killmonger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/chadwick-boseman-black-panther-900x506.jpg><p>Meanwhile, speculation about T’Challa’s replacement still takes center stage on social media whenever&nbsp;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&nbsp;is mentioned. Some fans believe that Letitia Wright’s character Shuri will take on the mantle left behind by her fictional brother, while past rumors suggested that the studio could still use Boseman in digital form. While the former is a good idea, the latter certainly isn’t something Marvel would consider. In an interview with Argentine newspaper&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarín</a>,&nbsp;Black Panther&nbsp;executive producer, Victoria Alonso confirmed that Marvel Studios will not be using a digital double of Chadwick Boseman for the sequel to the blockbuster film. They opted to rework the entire story instead, which could explain Michael B. Jordan’s return.</p><p>Chadwick Boseman lost his battle with colon cancer on August 28th. He was surrounded by his wife and family at the time. The actor shattered racial stereotypes when he became Marvel’s first leading Black superhero, and starred in&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, and&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame. He will be remembered and cherished as one of the most loved superheroes of all time.</p><p>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&nbsp;will be a direct&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sequel</a>&nbsp;to its predecessor. We can expect to see Michael B. Jordan surprise audiences in his appearance in the film. It is also the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ryan Coogler will return as director, working from a script he co-wrote with Joe Robert Cole. The movie will star Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, and Dominique Thorne. Production on&nbsp;Black Panther 2&nbsp;began in June, taking place in Atlanta and Brunswick, Georgia, and around Massachusetts. The crew went on hiatus in November but will resume filming in January.&nbsp;Black&nbsp;Panther: Wakanda Forever&nbsp;is scheduled to be released on November 11, 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ilmZi1orHLZplmop%2BnsaK6jJujmpubYr2iutOhnKtlYmKwsLrFoqmmnZRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./megan-thee-stallion-mariah-carey-are-2023-pride-in-the-park-headliners.html><span>←</span><span>Megan Thee Stallion &amp;amp; Mariah Carey Are 2023 Pride In The Park Headliners</span></a>
