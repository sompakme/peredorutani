Brown, the first overall pick in 2001 who never quite lived up to the hype of that draft position, was angry at LeBron following the Lakers' exit from the playoffs.</p><p>“I have never seen a guy of your caliber, supposed caliber, you don’t even get a shot off?” Brown said at one point in his seven-minute rant. “You’re probably the best scorer in the game, you got all these points. But you were looking for a bailout, again.” At another point in the video, Brown argues that “Throughout history, the little nerds are gonna look up your statline and say ‘He’s gotta be the greatest player to ever play the game’. And people who actually play are gonna know that is bullshit.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shannon-sharpe-and-kwame-brown-feud>Shannon Sharpe And Kwame Brown Feud</h2></span><p>"Of all the people, [Brown] should never ever question anyone's greatness," Sharpe said on Undefeated. “You on the Mount Rushmore of all busts….you a joke real talk." Drafted first overall by the Wizards in 2001, Brown averaged 6.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 0.9 assists over a 12-year career. Other players drafted after Brown in the 2001 draft include Tyson Chandler, Pau Gasol, and Tony Parker. By comparison, LeBron averaged 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 6.9 assists over the first 12 years of his career.</p><p>Brown has since responded to the Hall of Fame tight end's comments. "How you gonna invalidate a number draft pick, boy?" Brown said early in his lengthy response to Sharpe. "How about you put some bass in your voice when you talk?...You on a panel with a white boy who blames his coach for not making it to college." Brown proceeds to mock the way Sharpe talks while reiterating that Sharpe is a "guest in the house of basketball". Brown, who received 0 votes for Rookie of the Year and never made an All-Star Game or All-NBA appearance, did not appreciate Sharpe's take. However, what do you think? Is Kwame clowning or does Sharpe need to stay in his lane?
