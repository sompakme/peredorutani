Today, we are checking out Houston, Texas multi-talent DeeBaby. Not to be confused with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DaBaby</a>, we are checking out DeeBaby because his new album Can You Hear Me Now is here. The soon-to-be 28-year-old is drawing a lot of comparisons to artists like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kevin Gates</a>, Moneybagg Yo, and maybe even a splash of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rod Wave</a>. That is because of his efforts to rap over booming Southern-fried trap beats.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He also likes to speak about his life experiences, as well as not being afraid throw some brags out there. For DeeBaby, this is following up on his 2023 record Junkie Mode, which also got the Chopped & Screwed treatment. However, this is third offering overall, with Black Sheep being his debut in 2021. Even though he has been garnering attention as of late, he has been working toward star status for a few years.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-can-you-hear-me-now-by-deebaby>Listen To Can You Hear Me Now By DeeBaby</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">His first ever release came back in 2018 with "Venice." Can You Hear Me Now is just one of many accomplishments for DeeBaby, though. He has been dropping single after single and contributing to other artists' work. For example, he was teamed up with the likes of King Khemoo, YTB Fatt (who is on this LP), as well as Brown Money Mindz and fellow Texan That Mexican OT. See why DeeBaby is deserving of the attention by checking out his new tape above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on&nbsp;Can You Hear Me Now&nbsp;by&nbsp;DeeBaby?
