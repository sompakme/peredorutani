LAVA SAUCE</h2><p>One user wrote: “What happened to the volcano menu/lava sauce, bring it back it’s been since 2015.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Fast Food">Read More on Fast Food</h2><p>Lava Sauce started way back in the summer of 1995 as the company introduced the Volcano Taco, according to the fan site Taco Bell Fandom.</p><p>The sauce was a spicy nacho cheese sauce that added a fiery kick to menu offerings for several years.</p><p>Years later, the Volcano Menu grew to include the Volcano Burrito and the Volcano Nachos, which included Lava Sauce.</p><p>However, even though the Lava Sauce became a selling point for the Volcano Menu, the company saw a decrease in sales.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>The sauce was discontinued in September 2013 despite many social media campaigns to bring it back.</p><p>Shortly after in 2015, the sauce came back but only briefly.</p><h2>2. THE BOSS WRAPS</h2><p>Originally added in 2015, the Boss Wraps were similar to a Crunchwrap Supreme.</p><p>Customers had the option of grabbing either the Steak and Potato Boss Wrap or the Fully Loaded Steak Boss Wrap.</p><p>The Steak and Potato Boss Wrap had a double portion of steak, crispy potatoes, chipotle sauce bacon, and a three-cheese blend wrapped in a handheld tortilla.</p><p>The Fully Loaded Steak Boss Wrap had a double portion of steak, guacamole, pico de gallo, and avocado ranch sauce, also with a three-cheese blend wrapped in a handheld tortilla.</p><p>One user commented on the Twitter post: "And the boss wraps, 2015 was Taco Bell's golden year."</p><h2>3. COOL RANCH DORITOS LOCOS TACO</h2><p>Back in 2019, Taco Bell discontinued its Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Taco leaving many fans devastated.</p><p>The beloved menu item left along with nine others including the Beefy Mini Quesadilla, Chips & Salsa, Chipotle Chicken Loaded Griller, Double Decker Taco, Double Tostada, Power Menu Burrito, and the XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito.</p><p>One user commented: "Cool Ranch Doritos Tacos were so good that supply could not meet demand and were therefore discontinued. Bring back the Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Taco."</p><h2>4. CARAMEL APPLE EMPANADA</h2><p>The fan favorite left in 2019 as the chain quietly discontinued the popular dessert.</p><p>The Caramel Apple Empanada had hot fillings of gooey caramel and spiced apple.</p><p>The shell had a combination of a flaky exterior and a soft, pastry interior.</p><p>One user commented: "I will never get over Taco Bell removing the caramel apple empanada from the menu."</p><h2>NEW ITEMS</h2><p>While fans may miss their favorites, the <a href=#>taco chain has reintroduced</a> five menu items.</p><p>Nationwide, foodies can now start enjoying the Double Steak Grilled Cheese Burrito, Bacon Club Chalupa, and either the Blue Raspberry or Wild Cherry Freeze.</p><p>However, it has also added two new items: Cheesy Chicken Crispanada and Double Stack $2 tacos.</p><p>Just remember that while you're enjoying the old favorites, don't forget to say so long to the Quesarito as it will be coming off menus on April 19.</p><p>Plus, earlier this year, <a href=#>Taco Bell reintroduced</a> its Cantina Crispy Melt Taco.</p><p>For just $2.49, customers can&nbsp;order&nbsp;the item, which is now known as the Crispy Melt Taco.</p><p>It features a fried white corn shell, a layer of gooey nacho cheese, your choice of beans or seasoned beef, topped with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and a three-cheese blend.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Meanwhile, McDonald’s is <a href=#>shaking up its menu</a> as well after making three major changes.</p><p>Plus, customers are heartbroken after<a href=#> six items get discontinued</a> from Dunkin’ menus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbINxgpVvb2icmaiwsLrToqWunZRitrWxzKxkrZmTpHqjsculZJuqmaO0bq7AnKJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fan-casting-therica-wilson-read-as-sabrina-glevissig-in-the-witcher-on-mycast.html><span>←</span><span>Fan Casting Therica Wilson-Read as Sabrina Glevissig in The Witcher on myCast</span></a>
