According to <a href=#>Pro Ballers</a>, Petrakova was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1984, when the country was <a href=#>still aligned with the Soviet Union</a>. She went on to play for the Russian national team, racking up plenty of trophies and accolades along the way. Petrakova was part of the winning team for the women's 2012 European Cup, 2013 EuroLeague, and the 2013 Europe SuperCup. She also competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics, where Russia came fourth.</p><p><a href=#>Telecom Asia Sport</a> reports that basketball is in Petrakova's blood as her father, Viktor Petrakov, played for the Russian men's team. She studied in the USA before returning to Russia to further her sports career. After the 2017 season ended, Petrakova decided to retire from playing and focused her skills on coaching instead. Per <a href=#>The Bleacher Report</a>, Parker actually played with Petrakova on the same Russian team, UMMC Ekaterinburg, for three years.</p><p>Like Parker, Petrakova was involved with a man before the two women married. She was in a long-term relationship with Nikita Kurbanov, captain of the CSKA team. Parker first started appearing on Petrakova's <a href=#>Instagram</a> in 2018. "These two right here <a href=#>#oneofakind</a> <a href=#>#thanksforhavingmeinyourlife</a>," she captioned a photo of Parker and her daughter posing on the red carpet on June 9.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm9laoBze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2Yrq%2BwwJycZqiRp7imvtJmrqKelWKur7rAZqeerKKWuLDCwGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-hanburys-at-home-inside-polo-player-charlie-and-wife-yoanna-s-majestic-family-house.html><span>←</span><span>The Hanburys at home: Inside polo player Charlie and wife Yoanna's majestic family house</span></a>
