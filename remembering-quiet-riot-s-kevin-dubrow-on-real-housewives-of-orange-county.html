Now a plastic surgeon with his own jaw-dropping reality show — E!’s Botched (moving to the post-Kardashian 10 p.m. slot on June 29), co-starring <strong>Paul Nassif</strong>, a househusband formerly of the Beverly Hills edition —&nbsp;Dubrow keeps his late siblings’ memory alive by displaying rows of platinum albums in his tony Newport Beach home and speaking of him as often as he can. “I will never forget the day I came home from med school at UCLA and there was a message from my mom [saying], “Your brother’s album is No. 1,” Dubrow recalls. “No. 2 was Thriller and No. 3 was <strong>Lionel Richie</strong>. It was huge.”</p><p>Growing up, the two siblings were close. As Terry Dubrow recalls: “We lived in a two-bedroom apartment, and I shared a room with Kevin, who was three years older than me. I had a little desk where I would be studying my mathematics, and there were pictures of <strong>Roger Daltrey</strong>, <strong>Jimi Hendrix</strong> and <strong>Eric Clapton</strong>. … He had a drum set in there.”</p><p><strong>STORY <a href=#>Plastic Surgery Suicide Puts Spotlight on Beverly Hills Patients’ Desperation, Lies and Mental States</a></strong></p><p><img decoding=async alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Quiet%20Riot%20Metal%20Health%20cover%20S.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>Upon Dubrow’s death — he was found dead in his Las Vegas Home on Nov. 25, 2007, at the age of 52 — his brother and mother gathered his possessions, and that was when Terry Dubrow decided to bring the platinum records home. “We thought we would display them prominently in our house in his memory and his honor,” says Dubrow. “It is something we hold in high regard. It’s great that my four children know that their uncle was a big-time rock star.”</p><p>Even after decades of chanting “Bang Your Head,” Dubrow insists his older bro “didn’t need plastic surgery.” As for the unfortunate ones who come to Botched asking to look like <strong>Justin Bieber</strong>: “It’s a cautionary tale,” he says.</p><p>Curiously, Dubrow isn’t the only Real Housewives alum with a music-business connection.&nbsp;<strong>Lisa</strong> <strong>Vanderpump</strong>, of Beverly Hills fame, starred in the video for ABC’s 1985 hit, “Poison Arrow,” while <strong>David</strong> <strong>Foster</strong>‘s wife, <strong>Yolonda</strong>, is featured on the Beverly Hills edition. But Atlanta’s <strong>Kandi</strong> <strong>Burruss</strong>, a Grammy-winning songwriter with credits on TLC’s hit “No Scubs” and Destiny’s Child’s “Bills, Bills, Bills,” takes top prize; her wedding special drew 2.6 million viewers to Bravo on June 22.</p><p>Twitter: <a href=# rel=nofollow>@micheleamabile</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2Bnsq6xzJucq6GenHqywcieq2aqmaTBtHnKnq2ipl2ZwqO%2BzrBkcGlla39zew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lgm-ott-release-date-collection-ott-platform-hit-or-flop.html><span>←</span><span>LGM OTT Release Date, Collection, OTT Platform, Hit or Flop</span></a>
