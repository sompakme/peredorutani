Kevin Fox had previously told investigators that his daughter had been wearing a shirt with a pink flamingo and pink capri pants the last time he saw her. Riley still wore the shirt, but her pants and underwear were gone. She had duct tape, dirt, and mud on her face, and a bruise on her head. <a href=#>ABC News</a> reports that Riley drowned to death and had been sexually assaulted; investigators found saliva in her vagina. Kevin and Melissa fox were beyond shattered by this news.</p><p dir=ltr>In a shocking turn of events, <a href=#>The Cinemaholic</a> explains that the authorities arrested Kevin five months after Riley's murder. Per Chicago Magazine, investigators brutally interrogated a sleep-deprived Kevin for more than 14 hours. In the end, Kevin told investigators that in the early morning on June 6, 2004, he accidentally hit Riley with the door. Thinking he had killed his daughter, Kevin made her death appear to be a kidnapping and sexual assault case. He bound and gagged her and drove to the creek. ABC News writes that investigators charged Fox with first-degree murder.</p><p dir=ltr>Despite this, with Melissa and his family's support, Kevin maintained his innocence (via Chicago Magazine). Kevin told his family and attorney that the police had coerced him into a <a href=#>false confession</a>. They believed him; the story and the evidence did not add up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHFtcmhiZMGpsYytqa6kqWK1sL7Rop2im12Yv6q5xGaqnJ2emnqwsoyroKWdqWKzsMSO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shay-mitchell-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Shay Mitchell Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth</span></a>
