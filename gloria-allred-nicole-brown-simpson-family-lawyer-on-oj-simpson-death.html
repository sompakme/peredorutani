The family of the former football star and actor announced Thursday that the 76-year-old <a href=#>died from cancer.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Brown Simpson was famously found murdered in 1994 outside her Brentwood condominium, along with her friend Ronald Goldman. Her late ex-husband,&nbsp;O.J. Simpson, was accused of their murders and ultimately acquitted of the charges.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In wake of the news of Simpson’s death, Allred shared that she isn’t mourning the controversial figure and called upon the public to remember the victims instead.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Of course I immediately feel sorry for his children. O.J. Simpson did kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, may they rest in peace,” Allred <a rel=nofollow href=#>told New York’s local ABC station</a>. (Brown Simpson and Simpson were married for seven years and shared two children.)</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Continuing to share her thoughts, Allred said she felt “that the system failed Nicole Brown Simpson and failed battered women everywhere.” Simpson was later found liable for the deaths of Brown Simpson and Goldman in a 1997 civil lawsuit.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“In the civil case which followed, he was found liable, responsible for her wrongful death. So, it’s fair to call him a killer. But in any event, I don’t mourn for O.J. Simpson. I do mourn for Nicole Brown Simpson and her family. They should be remembered. The system failed,” she said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When reflecting on the high-profile case, Allred argued that the system failed because prior to the slayings, Simpson allegedly abused his ex-wife.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Sometime earlier, he’d given her a black eye. She’d run from the house, she’s hiding in the bushes, she was terrified. What did the system do? They let him plead no contest to battery, gave him no jail time, so that emboldened him, that empowered him, and ultimately he killed her,” Allred continued. “This has to change. We talk about O.J. Simpson all day long, that’s fine, but let’s remember the victims, because they’re very important.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Upon news of Simpson’s death, Lifetime announced that Brown Simpson will be getting the <a href=#>docuseries treatment</a> and will be the subject of what is planned to be a two-night event titled&nbsp;The Life and Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In addition to Allred, others in the industry also <a href=#>shared their reactions </a>to Simpson’s death, including Caitlyn Jenner — who married Kris Jenner shortly after her divorce from Simpson’s defense attorney Robert Kardashian — who tweeted “Good riddance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKi4zqugmmWRobmzscNmpqNlo566sb%2FOp2SdnZGptW66yJympZ1dl7%2Bww81mqqKloKi8r3mQa2pucGdngnGFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edward-masry-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Edward Masry Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
