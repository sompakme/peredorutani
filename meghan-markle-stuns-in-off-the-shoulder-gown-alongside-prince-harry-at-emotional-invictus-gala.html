Thank you all for being here tonight and for your commitment to making Invictus Games Vancouver Whistler 2025 possible. These games have been so warmly welcomed by our Four Host First Nations, who have opened their arms and land to each of us, not only tonight but in the lead up to and during the Games next year. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Your generosity is cherished.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekaW1RdUD6>Our collective journey through truth and reconciliation is an important one for all of us, and as we come here to learn, my hope is we can depart and return as friends.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQF1NHAX2n>When I am with the Invictus community surrounded by so many brave men and women who have served their countries with distinction, I feel humbled and at home. Your passion, commitment, and spirit has built a platform on which British Columbia will develop our first ever winter-hybrid Games, including first-time sports sit-skiing, sit-snowboarding, curling, biathlon and of course, skeleton.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXz8JWv8E7>As we look forward to next year’s games, we are reminded of the progress we have made, the challenges we have overcome, and the victories we have celebrated. Our journey has been marked by courage, determination, and an unwavering commitment to shared values of service, sacrifice, and community.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep8-WEjTgF>This year will mark ten years of the Invictus Games. The past decade has been a testament to the power of resilience and the unbreakable spirit you all exemplify. And boy have we had fun on the way!&nbsp;</p><p id=ekDBoqURCm>From this trip, I am happy to report the air is thick with excitement, and the best part is, we’re just getting started. The Invictus Games are not just a competition; they’re a way of life, a celebration of the human spirit. The games provide a platform for us to showcase your abilities, to inspire the world, and honour the sacrifices of those we have lost. It is a reminder that we are not defined by our injuries, but by our strength, our commitment, and our ability to overcome adversity.&nbsp;</p><p id=eE8bDTty4E>Invictus is not necessarily about winning a medal, but about the bonds that are built between nations; about the shared journey of recovery that competitors and their families are a part of. Tonight, we take one big step on that journey and in less than 365 days, we welcome the world to join us once again for another epic week.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7X22Bl75H>I ask each of you tonight to go out and share our message with the world. Tell your friends and family, your network, that on February 8th, 2025, they should join us here, or make sure they are tuning in and watching, sharing stories on social media and continuing to share the Invictus spirit long after the games are over.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHgned6G6I>As we continue to prepare for next year, let us remember the words of William Ernest Henley, the poet whose work serves as the namesake for The Invictus Games. "I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul."&nbsp;</p><p id=eACnHvCfID>Let us embrace these words, and let us continue to inspire each other, and the world, with courage, with leadership, and with fortitude. Thank you, and I can’t wait to see you back here in Canada, very soon. _____________________________________________________</p><p id=eyB0rKTgt7a data-wc=32>She poignantly remarked: "Our disabilities and our injuries don’t define us.
