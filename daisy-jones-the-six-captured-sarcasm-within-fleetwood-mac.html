The interview follows <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Nicks tweeting her response to the show,</a> which was adapted from Taylor Jenkins Reid’s novel, while watching the series back in August. Reid has previously said that she pulled from several ’70s bands for inspiration, including Fleetwood Mac.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While discussing the eerie similarities between her own life and what she was seeing onscreen, Nicks pointed to one specific element of Keough and Claflin’s dynamic as the biggest reason why she saw herself in their relationship.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It was a very simple thing. It was the kind of snappy sarcasm between Daisy and Billy, who in my mind was like me and Lindsey,” she explained. “It was the back-and-forth between the two of them. It was so good. It was so real, and it was really so right on.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nicks added that it wasn’t the looks that either actor brought forth for their characters that made her see herself and Buckingham in the show. Instead, it was the electric and magnetic energy Keough and Claflin brought forth, particularly in those charged moments between their characters Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When two people capture the essence of something that reminds you of your life, it’s not like you go,&nbsp;‘They look just like us,’&nbsp;or&nbsp;‘They dress just like us.’&nbsp;It’s something else. It’s a certain feeling that they got when they would look at each other after being in an argument, and then they’d start to sing. It would blow your mind,” she said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I would be watching and be like,&nbsp;‘Well, there you go,'” she continued.&nbsp;“That’s exactly why we did it. That’s exactly why Fleetwood Mac stayed together for 50 years. It was all for the music. It was all just to keep the music going, and the show got it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nicks also shared her favorite lyric from the fictional band’s catalog before lauding Keough and Claflin for their vocal performances, despite both admitting that they’d had little vocal training going into the show. For Nicks, the performances were impressive enough she’d consider signing the duo as a real band.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“My favorite is the one&nbsp;that goes, ‘We could make a good thing bad.’ That was my favorite,” Nicks said, referring to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>the “Honeycomb” track</a>. “If it was another time, another day, and there had never been a Fleetwood Mac and I had watched that, and I was a record A&R person, I would’ve said,&nbsp;‘We need to call them now. We need to sign them now.’ I really felt that. Considering that it seems like neither of them sang much before this, they did an amazing job.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At another point in the interview, the Fleetwood Mac singer expressed that she doesn’t think there’s a return for the chart-topping, genre-smashing band following member following <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christine McVie’s death in November 2022 at 79</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When Christine died, I felt like you can’t replace her. You just can’t. Without her, what is it?” the singer reflected. “We were on our own in that band. We always were. We protected each other. Who am I going to look over to on the right and have them not be there behind that Hammond organ? When she died, I figured we really can’t go any further with this. There’s no reason to.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrKuerpmaeq%2B1wqSqZpyRnsC6ecmopZ6rXZa7pXnToZxmq5mteqe4xJ6rsKefmXqurcJmaGtrZWt9d4KVcWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-you-eat-cooked-prosciutto-when-pregnant.html><span>←</span><span>Can you eat cooked prosciutto when pregnant?</span></a>
