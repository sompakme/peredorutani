Athletes perform tasks given and explained by a coach or a teacher. Athletes rely on the coach. On this stage, there will be a lot of mistakes and attempts. External feedback is extremely important.</p><p class=h3>Verbal Motor or Associative Phase</p><p class=align-left>It is a phase of practice, performances become motor programs. Simpler skills seem well learned, while more complex elements require more attention and practice.
