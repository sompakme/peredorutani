"I‚Äôm in Heaven! It‚Äôs been such a blessing being here with my family in Colorado for Christmas," she captioned the post. "It‚Äôs important for me to be able to share both worlds with our children as they growup. Nothing is better than family time! Hope you all had a happy holiday!"<br></p><p>In 2017, Heidi posted another holiday Instagram with family members‚Äîbut noticeably missing is her sister, Holly.</p><p>"This was the best Thanksgiving of my life! So thankful for my family! @gunnerpratt first Thanksgiving! Also the first holiday I have hosted at my house," she said. "Life gets so busy and there‚Äôs so many things going on. I love the holidays to reflect on what I am truly thankful for and what matters in life. To me love is the most important thing. üíô I am so thankful our family continues to expand!"<br></p><p>(Also, can we please take a moment to observe that borderline-creepy portrait of Speidi in the background?!)</p><p>It seems Heidi and Holly were on good terms back in 2015 when Heidi was spotted&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/heidi-montag-pregnant-sister-holly-montag-belly-bikini-pics-201543/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>rubbing her pregnant sister's stomach on the beach</a>. However, neither of the sisters have posted pictures of each other on their personal accounts the last couple years. And because we know social media isn't reality, it's unclear what the sisters' relationship looks like today.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
