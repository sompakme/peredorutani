The mom of four (two biological children and two stepchildren <a href=#>with ex Brandon Blackstock</a>) previously admitted to <a href=#>Redbook</a>&nbsp;that she has her private "goal weight" she would like to hit. However, the singer made a decision early on to love herself and her body and to ignore people with anything negative to say. "What I am glad about is, I think so many things happened to me when I was young about my weight that, even at a young age — like, so many things got said — that's whenever I was just like: 'Whatever, I'm not gonna please anyone,'" she recalled with Bertinelli.</p><p dir=ltr>If you need help with an eating disorder, or know someone who is, help is available.
