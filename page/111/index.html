<a href=../../does-high-spin-damage-clothes.html></a>
Busted: False! Delicate items are more likely to be damaged when you're using the maximum spin speed. Fabric such as wools, silks and lace are going to get more wear and tear when spun at 1600rpm, or when put on a quick wash cycle. Is high spin good for clothes? Spinning silk at high speeds can damage the fabric, weakening it so it tears easily. Bear in mind that higher speeds are more 'violent' and your clothes may come out creased as a result.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Inn on the Lake Hotel Review, Lake District</h2><time>Jul 17, 2024</time>
