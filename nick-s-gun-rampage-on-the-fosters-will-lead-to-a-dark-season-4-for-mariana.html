Obviously, Nick’s instability was rooted in other factors —&nbsp;like his relationship with his father and his home life —&nbsp;however, when he peeped Mariana kissing Mat, it was the final straw.</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BUK_2324-2.jpg alt="Kevin Jonas" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Kevin Jonas’ Daughter Dressed up Like Him for School & the Picture Is Pure Perfection</span></a></p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Sorry, Brallie haters, we’ve got bad news for you for </a><a href=# id=auto-tag_the-fosters_1 data-tag=the-fosters>The Fosters</a> Season 4</p><p>Clearly, all this isn’t lost on Mariana, and Cierra Ramirez, the actress who plays her, says Mariana’s part in the code blue and lockdown situation with Nick will haunt her for the rest of The Fosters Season 4.</p><p>“It’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">definitely going to set the mood for Mariana</a> for the rest of the season,” Ramirez said in a recent interview with TVGuide. “It’s going to put her in a very dark place. She’s left with this guilt that she thought it was all because of her… It’s definitely something she’s going to have to live with every day.”</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>The Fosters sacrificed Callie’s future to teach a lesson about right & wrong</a></p><p>But before you worry about Mariana too much,&nbsp;Ramirez also says that her character will rally by getting involved with robotics and coding —&nbsp;and she hopes the journey will serve as an inspiration for people who have gone through a situation similar to Mariana’s in real life.</p><p>“You never thought that [Nick] would go to this extreme. It is important for girls to see this and to know that they are not alone,” Ramirez said. “I’m really excited about the robotics that Mariana is getting into… It’s important to show girls that it’s cool to code —&nbsp;to be a girl and to code. Hopefully, Mariana can inspire girls to get into that field as well.”</p><p>And if you were kinda hoping that Mariana might reunite with Mat now that Nick is obviously out of the picture —&nbsp;it’s not gonna happen.</p><p><strong>More:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>The Fosters‘ Sherri Saum reveals the silver lining in Lena’s kissing scandal</a></p><p>“She’s probably going to go with her heart, but after this situation she’s left afraid to love,” Ramirez said. “She needs to take time for herself.”</p><p>The Fosters airs Monday nights on Freeform at 8/7c.</p><h3>How do you feel about how Mariana handled the situation with Nick and Mat?</h3><p>Before you go, check out our slideshow below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BUK_2324-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoaWFngnKFkGiroZ1dm7y0wMSrqmarlZbAsLqMbWSeqJmovKWxjGtm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./laura-quaynor-car-accident-plainfield-il-associate-professor-at-johns-hopkins-university-has-died.html><span>←</span><span>Laura Quaynor Car Accident, Plainfield IL, Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins University has died</span></a>
