The quarterback's unique cadence has gained attention on social media, especially after the team's recent win against the <a href=#><strong>Seattle Seahawks</strong></a>.</p><p>Prescott explained that the cadence was a way to communicate with his offensive linemen and get them ready for the play. "The linemen wanted a little something before, I guess. For me, it's to tell them stop the communicating, here we go," he said.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Dak Prescott is really worth $160 million?</span><span class=ue-c-article__media-author><span>Roberto Ortega</span></span></p></figure><p>When asked about who came up with the cadence, Prescott credited the coaching staff. "I think it was the coaches earlier in the offseason. I was like, 'If we're starting off like this, it's going to be a long offseason,'" he added.</p><p>The "Here we go" cadence was introduced this season after former offensive coordinator <strong>Kellen Moore</strong> and the <strong>Cowboys</strong> mutually parted ways. Head coach <strong>Mike McCarthy</strong> took over the offense and play-calling duties.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Dak has been playing at a high level</h2><p>Prescott's cadence has become a signature move for him this season. It has gained traction on social media, with fans and viewers discussing it during the team's games. The quarterback's ability to lead his team and make crucial plays has also been praised, especially after the Cowboys' win against the <strong>Washington Commanders</strong> on <strong>Thanksgiving</strong>.</p><p>In the game against Seattle, Prescott's performance was crucial in saving the team from a potential season-altering loss. Despite a historically bad defensive performance from the Cowboys, Prescott's leadership and playmaking abilities helped secure the win.</p><p>With the win against the Seahawks, <strong>Prescott and the Cowboys</strong> now have a chance to catch up to the 10-1 <strong>Philadelphia Eagles</strong> in the <strong>NFC East </strong>standings. The victory has given them hope and momentum as they continue their push for a playoff spot.</p><p>As the quarterback of the <strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong>, Prescott is well aware of the scrutiny and pressure that comes with his position. Every move he makes is analyzed and criticized by fans and media alike. However, he has shown resilience and determination throughout the season, leading his team through adversity and coming out on top.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqedpWeUlrmtrdJmmqivkqTGtHuRaWlsZ2FnfHF%2Bjm9sb5lmma9yfpFvZ2qcYWp9poTBbWxxbl6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-jim-caviezel-during-the-passion.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Jim Caviezel During The Passion?</span></a>
