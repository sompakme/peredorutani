In fact, he told Ellen on Tuesday (January 21) that he still isn't "over it" on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>return visit</a> to her show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"First of all, dangerous move for you to just do as a surprise while I was guest hosting because, as I've learned, there's a lot of balls in the air here. OK? You're juggling really quickly," he joked with Ellen. "And, you get hit with something like that—love of your life telling you it's not unrequited, in fact, he likes you back—that's overwhelming. But I proceeded on and we finished the show."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shepard revealed something even cooler than the fact hat he still wasn't over Pitt's reveal, though: the two went on a "date" together!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I went on a date with him," Shepard gushed. "I'm not kidding you. In Brad Pitt fashion, it was spectacular. We took a helicopter—you think I'm lying—we took a helicopter to a motorcycle track. We both love riding motorcycles. And just the two of us just took a jaunt up to this motorcycle track." Of course, Shepard has been married to actress <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kristen Bell</a> since 2013, so this wasn't a romantic date – but the beginning of a beautiful bromance, nevertheless.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I felt like Pretty Woman," Shepard continued. "I felt like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Julia Roberts</a> in Pretty Woman. I was waiting for him to set that chopper down on Rodeo and let me just go wild in one of those stores with his credit card. If it had happened, it wouldn't have surprised me. It was that incredible."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He called Pitt a "warrior on two wheels" thanks to his motorcycle prowess as well, though he didn't get a chance to check out the actor's six-pack given that the pair were decked out in all leather. He's got a plan for that next time, though.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Next date it'll hopefully be some kind of beach community where we can splash around a little bit," he said. "Brad, let's hit the beach, my friend."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeSp66lec%2Biq61lkaOxbrDAsWSsoJWlrrOwjKamraeimMakuMRmm5qslWKvs7vMmqWcnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-cast-of-yellowjackets-had-a-stylish-reunion-at-the-2024-emmys.html><span>←</span><span>The Cast of 'Yellowjackets' Had a Stylish Reunion at the 2024 Emmys</span></a>
