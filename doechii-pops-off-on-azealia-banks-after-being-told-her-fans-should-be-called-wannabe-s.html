Overall, she has come through with hit songs and has also delivered some fantastic projects. Additionally, she has worked with some of the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">biggest women artists in the entire game.</a> She is being recognized for her hard work, and it has led to an always-increasing fanbase. Unfortunately, despite this success, there are some people out there who are looking to hate on Doechii. One such person is none other than <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Azealia Banks</a>, who recently made some shady comments online.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">If you know anything about Banks, you know that she can be pretty mean. Her scathing critiques are usually reserved for the likes of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Beyonce</a>, and even Grimes. However, on Tuesday night, she decided to take aim at Doechii. In an Instagram comment, Banks insinuated that Doechii was an ugly version of her. Moreover, she said the artist should be referring to her fans as the "Wannabe's." It was a rude comment, and Doechii certainly took notice of it.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-doechii-makes-her-feelings-clear>Doechii Makes Her Feelings Clear</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This subsequently led to a clap back that was both strong and biting. "The first time you came for me I let it slide outta respect for my elders," Doechii began. "It's not my fault you selling bussy soap and I'm selling platinum records. Leave me alone PLEASE." If there is anything that can be learned here, it is that Doechii is not one to be played with. She is extremely confident in herself, and that is not going to change anytime soon. As for Banks, perhaps this beef is one worth squashing immediately.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this feud between Doechii and Azealia Banks, in the comments section down below.
