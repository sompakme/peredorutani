A six-time Pro Bowl and three-time NFL First Teamer, Johnson was an electric presence on the field. Most recently, however, Johnson traded balls and took part in the million-dollar The Soccer Tournament.

Read my bio for more info & what i excel at. üíØ," he wrote in the caption. Furthermore, Johnson changed his Instagram bio to reflect new passion. "‚ù§Ô∏è6x certified Lash Artist, ‚ù§Ô∏è53 years of horizontal experience, ‚ù§Ô∏èEsthetician & Zumba Instructor, Proud father of 85 & a possible."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another NFL player doing something for his daughter, albeit in a much different way, is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Shaq Barrett</a>. Barrett recently revealed a new tattoo to honor his daughter Arrayah, who tragically passed away in April. According to TMZ, Barrett and his wife recently visited celebrity tattoo artist Tattoo Red to get pieces honoring Arrayah. For Barrett, that was a large forearm piece immortalizing an image from Arrayah‚Äôs last birthday. Barrett‚Äôs wife Jordanna got a smaller piece on her wrist. According to Red, Barrett‚Äôs piece took about 5 hours to complete. ‚ÄúKnowing what an emotional piece this was for the family made me feel honored,‚Äù Tattoo Red said. ‚ÄúI wanted to give them the best piece I could.‚Äù</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
