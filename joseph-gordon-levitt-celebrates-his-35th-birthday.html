And since 1999's 10 Things I Hate About You, the hunky Hollywood actor's career has been full speed ahead. After a brief acting break to study at Columbia University, Gordon-Levitt returned to acting in 2004. He's since appeared in 500 Days of Summer, Inception, and The Dark Knight Rises.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When the birthday boy isn't in front of the camera, he's busy working as a filmmaker. In 2004, he founded the online production company, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>hitRECord</a>. Then, in 2013, he made his debut as director and screenwriter of a feature film with the release of Don Jon, a comedy film in which he also played the main role. Today, the do-it-all A-lister is gearing up for the release of his latest non-fiction film, Snowden, in which he plays Edward Snowden, a former CIA employee under fire for reportedly releasing classified information from the U.S. National Security Agency. The much-talked-about film hits theaters May 13.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With so many projects on his plate, Gordon-Levitt still manages to always arrive fresh-faced and dressed to the nines. Whether he's walking the red carpet or spending the day with wife, businesswoman Tasha McCauley, and their baby boy, Gordon-Levitt always brings his A-game in the looks department. To see for yourself, here are nine times Gordon-Levitt sizzled in a suit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeapMCmvMdmnqiqlKS7brjEr6CtrF2WtKZ5waKpraCUlsZursSsq2akn6S4tHnTqGSdmaSa</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-benigno-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Benigno Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
