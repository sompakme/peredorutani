When Neil realized that she wasn't an aging '80s bodacious bimbette looking to get backstage, he apparently lost his temper like a spoiled brat who isn't getting everything he wants. The "Live Wire" singer came up behind the woman, grabbed a fistful of her hair, and pulled her to the ground.</p><p>"The two AARP-eligible stars looked like a couple of sloppy Tyrannosaurus Rex tangling outside the Aria," <a href=#>wrote the L.A. Times</a> the day after the incident. A <a href=#>video obtained by TMZ</a> showed the moments just after the infantile attack. "I'm helping you!" Cage screams at the former Crüe member, who yells back, "I know!" And Nic continues to characteristically rage for his friend's own good. "I f****** love you. Stop this s*** now!" he screams before putting Neil into a sloppy headlock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BlW5saXFfqbWmecKopa2qn6uys7%2FImqNmoZ6YtqWxza1koqampLm3tc2gZK%2BhnpiybrrEoqNmmZ6Zeq%2B1wqijmqtdmK6osY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shohei-s-secret-revealed-how-sleep-has-aided-ohtani-s-excellence.html><span>←</span><span>Shohei's secret revealed?
