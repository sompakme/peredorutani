<a href=../../../taylor-swift-can-make-it-to-the-super-bowl-per-the-japanese-embassy.html></a>
This is getting silly.
It was already silly, to be sure, but now the whole Taylor Swift/NFL/Travis Kelce/Super Bowl thing is truly getting surreal and more than a little off the rails. Here’s the latest: Japan’s embassy in Washington, D.C., has released a statement about Swift’s travel plans.

<a href=../../../the-untold-truth-of-king-solomon.html></a>
Solomon was the son of King David of Israel, the one who killed Goliath and played a secret chord that pleased the Lord and all that. His mother was Bathsheba, a woman David had watched taking a bath, had to have, and then murdered her husband to cover up the adultery. The first child of this union had (quite unfairly, really) died for his parent's dirty sins. Their second child was born in wedlock and so prospered as a peace offering between David and God.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>There Is Freedom by Josh Baldwin</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>

That He is not

Where the Spirit of the Lord is
There is freedom
We'll be dancing through the darkness
'Cause we believe it</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Magic Johnsons son EJ Johnson?</h2><time>Sep 7, 2024</time>
