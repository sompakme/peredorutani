“It means a lot to me,” the versatile Naomi Ackie tells us of her 2023 BAFTA EE Rising Star nomination. It’s Ackie’s role in the Whitney Houston biopic I Wanna Dance With Somebody that everyone’s talking about, but you’ll know the London-based actress for her powerful portrayals in the Netflix series Master of None and Steve McQueen’s British drama Small Axe, too. “I've been working for about 10 years and so much has happened in that time that I'm so grateful for.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jaidyn Alexis Sends Out Interesting Tweets Amid Blueface &amp;amp; Chrisean Rock Reunion</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>

The woman most commonly affiliated with Blueface over the past few years is Chrisean Rock, but before she entered the picture, Jaidyn Alexis was the main female in the Californian's life. The latter duo have been in each other's lives before Blue rose to fame, and share two young sons who they've been successfully co-parenting for some time. We've been seeing Alexis spending plenty of time with her baby daddy this summer amid his constant feuding with Rock.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jason Momoa on Parenting, Vulnerability, and the Struggle to Get By</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>

On the morning of my interview with Jason Momoa in Los Angeles, I'm jolted awake in the predawn hours by one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the city in years. Later in the day a nasty brush fire breaks out near the house in Laurel Canyon where Momoa and I are set to meet, so on my way there I'm rerouted because a trio of fire trucks is blocking the main road.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Michael Bay Says Transformers: Age Of Extinction Will Be Less Goofy</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>

Director Michael Bay has built an empire around the Transformers film series. While audiences and critics universally pan the Transformers movies, the series is one of Paramount Pictures’ most profitable ones. Whether it has to do with nostalgia or Michael Bay’s penchant for loud explosions and action, the new film in the series, Transformers: Age of Extinction, will most likely be another big moneymaker for Paramount and Hasbro.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Tess Daly and daughter Phoebe could be sisters in matching mini-dresses for ultra-rare night out</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>

Phoebe opted for a cherry red ensemble, which she paired with classic nude pointed-toe heels.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Lisa Zbozen? Wiki, Age, Husband, Kids, Parents, Height, Net worth, Bio &amp;amp; More</h2><time>Sep 27, 2024</time>

I watch The Bachelorette every Sunday, and when The Bachelor is on, I watch that, too. I’ve always referred to the series as my guilty pleasure, but there’s really nothing to feel guilty about. The thing is, as a relationship expert and columnist, I see the value in this franchise: Through watching it, we can learn how to be our best selves while dating. In fact, I’m pretty sure that if we all dated like we were on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, we’d have an easier time developing healthy relationships.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>EasyJet returns to profit but warns of Gaza war impact</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>

Nicole Richie’s first fragrance is coming soon! When we announced last year that the Fashion Star judge would be releasing a scent, 49% of InStyle.com readers said they’d try it. And now we know what it looks like—the star released a photo of the bottle this week, and we’re loving how the art deco design mirrors the graphic elements used in her House of Harlow 1960 jewelry.
