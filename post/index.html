Time-honored actors always make for the best interviews. They’re freewheeling, delivering honest-to-goodness answers in lieu of vague observations prebaked by an army of high-priced publicists. Susan Sarandon, her divisive political views notwithstanding, is one of these actors.
And Morgan Freeman is another.
I’ve had the pleasure of interviewing Freeman, the Oscar-winning screen legend and star of countless cinema gems—from Street Smart and Glory to The Shawshank Redemption and Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy—about a half-dozen times, and he’s always impressed me with his unique wit and good humor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Nalini Sriharan Wiki (Rajiv Gandhi Assassination) Biography, Age, Husband, Daughter, Family, Book &amp;amp;</h2><time>Oct 2, 2024</time>

Becoming an&nbsp;authoritative voice isn’t easy. With each individual Twitter account serving as an instrument in the infinite orchestra, sometimes the dissonance can outweigh the discourse. Yet hip-hop is full of leaders, of writers whose livelihood rests on being compelling orators. Especially for those who dare to explore complex themes of societal equality, political status, and interpersonal connection. Doing so without credibility is a fool’s errand, and in a genre where artists continuously develop trust with their fanbase, a misstep can feel like a betrayal.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>River whose celestial mirror is the Milky Way, in ancient myths Crossword Clue</h2><time>Oct 2, 2024</time>
