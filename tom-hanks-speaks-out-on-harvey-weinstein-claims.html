Further adding, “Look, I don’t want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can’t buy, ‘Oh, well, I grew up in the ’60s and ’70s and so therefore …’ I did, too.”</p><p>Hanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative.</p><p>“I think it’s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,” the actor said.</p><p>“They think their achievements entitle them,” Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. “Somebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: ‘When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'” Hanks said.</p><p>Hanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul.</p><p>“I would say, there’s an example of how that’s true. Just because you’re rich and famous and powerful doesn’t mean you aren’t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away ‘fat,'” Hanks said. “But I’m not, you know, I’m not the first person to say Harvey’s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey — I’m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn’t it kind of amazing that it took this long? I’m reading it and I’m thinking ‘You can’t do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don’t do that. That ain’t fair. Not her, come on. Come on!”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Hanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says “had absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.”</p><p>The actor explained, “Those people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, ‘Hey, wait, that’s going on today? Shouldn’t we be on this?’ Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it’s happening? I can’t quite believe that.”</p><p>Hanks isn’t the only Hollywood star to comment on the recent Weinstein allegations.
