Buckle Up, Buttercup!</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:24><span>Thinking about strapping on a holster and joining the ranks of San Diego's lawfully concealed carry crew?</span><span> Awesome!</span><span> Just be prepared for a bit of a spendy adventure.</span><span> Gearing up for concealed carry isn't quite like picking up a pack of gum at the corner store.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:46>The Big Kahuna: Fees and Firearms Training</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:241><span>First things first,</span><span> there are those pesky permit fees.</span><span> The San Diego County Sheriff's Department charges a non-refundable application fee of around </span><strong>$160</strong><span>.</span><span> Think of it as your initiation fee to the exclusive club of licensed gun-toters.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:323><span>But that's not all,</span><span> my friend.</span><span> California law mandates that you take a certified training course.</span><span> Here's where things get interesting.</span><span> </span><strong>As of January 6th, 2024, the required training course has doubled to 16 hours!</strong><span> Budget for somewhere around </span><strong>$200 to $400</strong><span> for this class,</span><span> depending on the instructor you choose.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:206><strong>Pro Tip:</strong><span> Don't skimp on the training!</span><span> This is your chance to learn the laws,</span><span> safe handling practices,</span><span> and the finer points of shooting under pressure.</span><span> You want to be James Bond,</span><span> not Barney Fife,</span><span> right?</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=13:1-13:46>Beyond the Basics: Firearms and Fancy Fees</h3><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:320><span>Now,</span><span> let's talk about the piece de resistance:</span><span> your firearm(s).</span><span> The application fee covers listing up to 4 guns on your permit.</span><span> That sounds like a good deal,</span><span> until you realize there's a </span><strong>$25 fee</strong><span> to add firearms number 5 through 8,</span><span> and then it jumps to another </span><strong>$25 for every additional four firearms</strong><span> after that.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:139><strong>So, if you're a collector with an arsenal that would make Rambo jealous, this could get pricey.</strong><span> But hey,</span><span> at least you'll have options!</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=19:1-19:41>Don't Forget the Fingerprinting Fun!</h3><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:214><span>Finally,</span><span> there's the delightful task of getting fingerprinted.</span><span> The Sheriff's Department doesn't offer this service in-house,</span><span> so you'll need to find a Live Scan operator.</span><span> Fees typically run around </span><strong>$75 to $100</strong><span>.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:162><strong>Think of it as a small price to pay to avoid any confusion with that other San Diego resident with a fondness for firearms, like, you know, Bonnie and Clyde.</strong></p><h2 data-sourcepos=25:1-25:49>The Bottom Line: How Much Does it REALLY Cost?</h2><p data-sourcepos=27:1-27:192><span>So,</span><span> how much are we looking at grand total?</span><span> Well,</span><span> that depends on your firearm ambitions and your training course selection.</span><span> </span><strong>A safe ballpark estimate is somewhere between $500 and $900.</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=29:1-29:167><span>But hey,</span><span> look at the bright side!</span><span> Once you have your CCW permit,</span><span> you'll be the envy of all your non-licensed friends (or at least the ones who aren't scared of guns).</span></p><h2
