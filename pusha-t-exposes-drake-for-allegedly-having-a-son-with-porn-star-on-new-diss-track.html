“Since you named dropped my fiancée/ Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé/ Sophie knows better, ask your baby mother/ Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her/ A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap/ We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts/ You are hiding a child, let that boy come home/ Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh/ Adonis is your son/ And he deserves more than an Adidas press run, that's real/ Love that baby, respect that girl/ Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world (yuugh),” Pusha spits."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Sophie claimed to have proof, and hired two New York lawyers to help her obtain a paternity test with the rapper, as well as to seek child support if the child belonged to Drake. However nothing ever came about after that report, but Sophie continued to slam Drake for&nbsp;</span>being a "deadbeat dad" back in November even after her son was born.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">At the time of the scandal, Drake’s camp addressed Brussaux's claims in a statement, saying, "This woman has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships. We understand she may have problems getting into the United States. She’s one of many women claiming he got them pregnant. If it is in fact Drake’s child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out some photos of Drake & Sophie (below) and revisit Pusha's diss track&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">right here</a> if you haven't listened to it yet.
