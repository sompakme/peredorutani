That doesn’t exactly sound like a fair match-up but we’re pretty sure what’s coming in the <a href=#>Disney+</a> series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law won’t have as much to do with the two Marvel heroes trading physical blows as it will waging a legal battle. Regardless of what kind of conflict between the heroes is coming, it’s definitely on the way according to one of the show’s directors.</p><p>Kat Coiro (Marry Me), who directed six of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law‘s episodes, spoke to <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> about the series starting with the appearance of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock and his crime-fighting alter-ego, Daredevil. Coiro confirmed that it was Daredevil we all saw in the trailer — and not the obscure hero D-Man <a href=#>as some theorized</a> — and also confirmed that the relationship between Daredevil and She-Hulk in the series will be at least a little bit adversarial. “They match each other’s wits, is what I can say,” Coiro told EW. “I am definitely excited for Daredevil to make his appearance, because I think he’s going to be a crowd favorite. But I can’t tell you anything else about that. The Marvel police is a real thing and I don’t want to get arrested by them.”</p><p>If they’re going to be “matching each other’s wits” as Coiro says, then it seems in most likelihood — and unsurprisingly — Daredevil and She-Hulk won’t be trading punches in the street, but objections in the courtroom. If they are representing opposing clients, it should make you wonder whether or not Tatiana Maslay’s Jennifer Walters will be on the right side of things. When it comes to the courtroom, Matt Murdock generally is the broke lawyer representing the “little guy,” while we’ve seen in previews that Walters appears to be working for a large, wealthy law firm.</p><p>As great as it was for fans to get the confirmation that Charlie Cox’s Daredevil would appear in She-Hulk, it was far from a surprise. With Murdock and Walters being arguably the two most famous fictional lawyers in all of superhero comics, Daredevil was a natural addition to the series and was rumored to be a part of it almost as soon as She-Hulk was announced. Once Cox showed up in last year’s <a href=#>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>, confirming that — if nothing else — his Marvel character was officially a part of the MCU, that was practically a She-Hulk appearance confirmation all on its own.</p><p>Of course, it isn’t out of the realm of possibility that a courtroom conflict between Daredevil and She-Hulk could become a more physical one. But, if that were the case then it probably wouldn’t bode too well for Matt. Daredevil went one-on-one with Jennifer Walters’s cousin in 1980’s Daredevil #163 and, well… the paramedics were kind enough to leave his mask on. We’ll leave it at that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/daredevil-163.jpeg><p>We’re not sure exactly when in the run of She-Hulk: Attorney at Law we can expect Charlie Cox to make his appearance, but at the very least it will be pushed back a day. Originally announced to stream on Wednesday, August 17, the series <a href=#>will now premiere</a> on Disney+ on Thursday August 18. So no matter how Daredevil and She-Hulk “match wits,” it will unfold at least 24 hours later than originally planned.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ickaeypbHVoqNmq5iaeqnBy6RknKCRp7mqsYycprFmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brined-turkey-breast-recipe.html><span>←</span><span>Brined Turkey Breast | Recipe</span></a>
