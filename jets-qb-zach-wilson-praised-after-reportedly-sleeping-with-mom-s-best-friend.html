From a football perspective, Wilson has done nothing on the field to give fans any indication he will be good this year. Off the field, though, it seems like Wilson is making a name for himself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It all started when a report came out saying that Wilson's ex-girlfriend was sleeping with his old teammate and roommate at BYU, Dax Milne. When the ex-girlfriend in question, Abbey Gile, was called a "homie hopper," she responded by saying that Wilson is the true homie hopper as he slept with his mom's best friend.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can imagine, this drew massive reactions from NFL Twitter. When you find out this kind of information, you can always be sure there will be a fallout, and for a full day, Wilson was the main character of the NFL world. While it wasn't for his play on the field, at least the Jets can say that their QB was actually relevant for a few hours.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this big revelation, in the comments section down below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
