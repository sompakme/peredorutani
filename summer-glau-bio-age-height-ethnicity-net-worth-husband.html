Ballet dancing takes a lot of dedication, and performers take about ten years to become a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">classical ballet dancer</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Her dedication paid off as Glau gradually became a phenomenal dancer, was a soloist with her ballet company, and started working with a symphony at 14-years-old.
