While speaking to <a href=#>People</a> about her lack of romantic relationships, Yasbeck admitted that the prospect of welcoming someone new into her life feels a little too daunting. "I don't date," she said. "I mean, it could happen. [But] I'm not in the mood." She added that being around other men only makes her miss her husband even more. "... as weird as that sounds," she added. "Because I always feel like he's with me, and that would be weird because in that case, three is not company." According to <a href=#>Hollywood</a>, she echoed a similar sentiment during a later interview, explaining why she still refuses to hit the dating scene. "I still feel completely connected to him, so in love with him," the "Wings" star said. "I certainly wouldn't want to be the man who was compared to John Ritter through my eyes."</p><p>However, Yasbeck did manage to find love again several years after the shocking death of her husband. In 2011, she began dating attorney Michael Plonsker. They remained together until calling it quits in 2014. Yasbeck opened up about their romance in an interview with <a href=#>Naples Illustrated</a> back in 2013, in which she referred to Plonsker as her "lovely boyfriend." Meanwhile, a source told <a href=#>Radar</a>&nbsp;that Plonsker provided a shoulder for Yasbeck to cry on. "Over time, they grew closer and eventually fell in love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlaYF4fI6jpqGmXae2tcDEq2SwoZSkxG6tzLJkspmjl7Kkt4ynnK%2BdomLAornEZpifrJWneqm10mabnpmknXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-get-a-handyman-license-in-las-vegas.html><span>←</span><span>How To Get A Handyman License In Las Vegas</span></a>
