In fact, Sagal said she didn’t realize Married… with&nbsp;Children&nbsp;was a hit until she got an accessory for her character, Peggy.</p><p>“I think the first time we knew is when they bought me a wig,” she said. “Because for the first three years, I would just do my own hair. And then all of a sudden, they started dishing out money. Wigs are not cheap.”</p><p>She also noted that she and&nbsp;O’Neill went on a promotional tour and were shocked by the response.</p><p>“We went on some parade, dressed as Peg and Al, and it was wild,” she said. “There were so many people there. Ed and I thought no one was really going to watch it because it was so irreverent, so not like anything else on TV — which is why I think I got the job because I wasn’t like anything else on TV — and it really took off.”</p><p>She also noted that Fox at the time played the show three times a night in a row. “You couldn’t miss it,” she said. Married… with Children ran from April 5, 1987, to June 9, 1997.</p><p>Sagal currently stars in Rebel on ABC.</p><p>Watch the full interview below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOpJitnaliwKKzwKVknaGjmLy3sdGem2alkae%2FqrHDZq6irJhisKm1y52pnqZdrK60ecBmn6KsXau2onnPnp6gsaNitaK10WZram5jZ4Bzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kat-mohoaduba-biography-boyfriend-age-net-worth-wikipedia-husband-news-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Kat Mohoaduba Biography: Boyfriend, Age, Net Worth, Wikipedia, Husband, News, Pictures</span></a>
