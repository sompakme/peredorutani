I’m a Sagittarius! I like traveling and wandering, but the moment I arrived in NYC, it felt like home. There’s nothing like the energy the city gives me; the food scene is simply impeccable; and, given the fact I work in fashion, and the Big Apple is a fashion-focused city, I’m sartorially inspired everyday when I set foot outside of my apartment. The runways certainly tell you <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>what’s going to be big</a> in a few months, but the streets show what’s big now — and TBH, what trends are actually wearable IRL.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every time I feel like I need a boost of fashionable inspiration, I will search #NYCstreetstyle on any social media app&nbsp;— or, I’ll leave my apartment, people watch, and take note of the trends I’m seeing on repeat. And because sharing is caring — and because there’s such an interest and buzz around Big Apple, city girl fashion — I thought I’d spill the five trends I’ve seen nonstop the past few weeks. They’re certainly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>popular winter trends</a>, but they can just as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">easily transition into the springtime</a>, too, which means if you get in on it now, you can wear them for the next four months, too. Some even, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">those famous sneakers</a> that are nearly impossible to get your hands on, are totally summer-time appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, check out the five trends everyone in New York City is wearing right now.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sheer-tops></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sheer Tops</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sheer, see-through, nearly-naked anything has been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>trending for a while</a>, and said pieces are only going to get even more popular come spring, because, well, warmer weather means more skin. Sheer staples just make sense for the springtime, but honestly, they’re also totally in for winter, for the simple fact that they’re great layering pieces. Plus, you can easily adjust the level of sheerness you want; if you feel daring, layer a sheer top, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this lace turtleneck</a>, over a opaque bralette for a romantic, sexy moment; if that’s too much for you, swap the bralette for a cami and you’ll have the sheer effect in a modest way that’s totally wearable IRL. I’m trying this trend out next.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-glamourous-gloves></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Glamourous Gloves</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gloves are a no-brainer this time of year. It's cold, and our hands are the first to feel the freeze, so it’s normal for people to wear cashmere or wool gloves to keep their fingers nice and toasty. But this season, we’re seeing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a different type of glove enter the game</a>: glamorous ones that scream Old Hollywood, and I’m 100 percent here for it. In fact, as a bride getting married this summer, I have my eyes on white satin gloves with which to accessorize my bridal look. But, even if you’re not walking down the aisle or a red carpet (gloves were the “it” accessory among celebs this year), they’re totally easy to incorporate into your day-to-day. Picture: jeans, a button-down, and some cool faux-leather gloves. Talk about a lewk that shows you’re not afraid to stand out. Plus, gloves offer added stylish protection from germs, especially if you're commuting on the subway. A double win!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-red-red-red></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Red, Red, Red</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Calzedonia</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Red is everywhere. I don’t think I’ve ever seen as much red on the streets as I have in recent months — and the runways further proved the bold, confidence-boosting hue is here to stay, especially when you think about the impact of wearing it (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>read more here</a>). The nice thing is that you can pick your degree of red; go with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">bright-red hosiery</a> to hit on the red tight trend, or, throw on a cherry-colored sweater, layer it underneath an oversized coat, allowing just a pop of the color to shine through. Red means you’re not afraid to be noticed, but it’s totally okay to adjust the impact according to your comfort level. Start subtle and then maybe you’ll feel like you want to go bold. It’s the beauty of making fashion (and trends) feel like you.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blanket-scarves></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blanket Scarves&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s a solution for when you must leave your house, even though you’d much rather stay on the couch tucked underneath your cozy blanket: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a blanket scarf</a> that's cuddly, big, and wraps around you like a big bear hug. Ahhh. Yes, it is as amazing as it sounds, and yes, everyone in NYC has one, including icon <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Mary-Kate Olsen</a>; I pack my blanket scarf with me everywhere I go, not only because it’s a fashun piece that makes me look like a luxe lady, but also because it’s a smart style hack that keeps me extra warm on super cold days. Simply adjust the wrapping depending on the need; if you need warmth, I like to wear my big scarf like a shawl over my shoulders; but if I want it to be more of a stylish accessory, I nonchalantly wrap it around my neck and let it fall however it pleases.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-oversized-coats></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Oversized Coats&nbsp;</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Coats are a no-brainer this time of year, and while big, fluffy puffer coats are an NYC favorite, there’s been an uptick of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">structured, oversized outerwear</a> that reads refined and elegant. And it makes sense: When the temperature drops and you simply have to top off your ‘fit with a topper, said piece basically becomes your whole outfit (everything else is hidden underneath it, after all). So, slipping into a chic, stylish, timeless topper with structured shoulders, an oversized silhouette, testament buttons, or more of the like, is where the fun really starts. Not to mention, the more oversized the outerwear, the more easily you can layer it over your chunky sweaters. I particularly dislike being sized into a coat, so I sometimes even go a few sizes up for that XXL impact.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-adidas-sambas-sneakers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Adidas Sambas Sneakers</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s perhaps <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the most famous shoe in the world</a> — okay, the “world,” in this case, being New York City. I simply cannot set foot outside without seeing at least 10 people wearing the famous <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Adidas Sambas sneakers</a>. Everytime I’m on the subway, I play a game of spot the Sambas, and every time, the number goes up. And it makes sense — it’s nearly impossible to get your hands on the style; they’re sold out at most places, but restocks do happen, and I found a few colors in ample stock right now. So, snag your pair now because yes, they are worth the hype. My mom and I are obsessed; I wear my Sambas almost every day — save for when it’s rainy because they’re too nice to ruin. They’re super comfy, and give any look an instant cool factor. I’m buying another pair as I type.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXZqxqsDOq2Ssr5miwLa102anopubqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-a-quitclaim-deed-in-texas.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is A Quitclaim Deed In Texas</span></a>
