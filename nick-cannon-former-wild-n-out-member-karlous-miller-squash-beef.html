Since that time, things have been tense between the two, but it looks as if all has been made right between them.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Cannon shocked his&nbsp;Wild 'N Out audience and cast members by bringing out a surprise guest that was none other than Karlous, a move that many never believed would happen. Cannon welcomed Karlous back to the stage with open arms and the two engaged in a light-hearted battle rap to poke fun at the moment.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Me and Nick actually had a long talk after&nbsp;The Breakfast Club and I guess it was just a talk that needed to be had because it was like, 'Nah, this is not what I said or what I represent,'" Karlous told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">TMZ</a>.&nbsp;"There was just a<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> break down in the communication</a>, and once we opened the communication back up, everything was kosher, baby. And that's how I ended up being the surprise guest. Because after our talk, me and him discussed it, and he was like 'You can come back and do whatever you want.'"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Man, Nick is forever family," Karlous added. "Me and Nick will always be good.&nbsp; That man gave me so many opportunities and helped me create a better life for myself. I would never have any hard feelings against Nick or anything he has going on. He's incredible family."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
