Ever since transferring from the University of Maryland to head to Louisiana State, she has had to constantly deal with scrutiny. Her competitive fire on and off the hardwood has led her to be viewed as a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">controversial figure</a>. Unfortunately, most of hate she has gotten over the last two years or so has pretty much been unearned. However, when you join a major program, more eyes and ears are on you at all times. Of course, the main headline that swirled around the power forward was her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">alleged low GPA</a>. What was really surprising throughout all of that was that Flau'jae Johnson's (a now former teammate) parents were <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">feuding</a> with Angel's parents about this. However, with Angel Reese graduating from LSU, she can put a damper on them and everyone else who had something to say.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to The Shade Room, the number seven overall draft pick of the Chicago Sky posted some pictures of her in her "Bayou Barbie" graduation cap and black suit just yesterday. Angel graduated in four years with a major in interdisciplinary studies and minors in communication studies, leadership development and psychology. The caption for the post was fitting, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">addressing</a> all of the doubters and fools who believed the supposed fake news. "So now what? what was said? oh okay that‚Äôs what i thought. I graduated from THE LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY IN 4 YEARS ON TIMEüíã i thought somebody without a college degree said sum.üòò"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-angel-reese-silences-her-gpa-hounders>Angel Reese Silences Her GPA Hounders</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Supporters came in droves to congratulate Angel across all of her social media accounts. "oh cause who not pretty & smart? i see a BIG GRAD that‚Äôs TOP PRIORITY ü§≠üòò" one user writes. "OH OKAYYY! Congratulations!üéâ üéìBeauty, brains, & talent!üî•" another adds. We will never know the true <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">reason</a> why Angel Reese missed time, but that information honestly does not need to come out. Congratulations to the grad!</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Angel Reese graduating from Louisiana State University?
