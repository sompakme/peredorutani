Having a hard time keeping up with Gen-Z’s ever-changing list of slang words? You’re not the only one.
This morning, Oxford Languages revealed that “rizz” has been announced as 2023′s “word of the year”.
The term, which was catapulted to popularity by Spider-Man actor Tom Holland in a Buzzfeed interview seven months ago, is the slang term for “romantic appeal” or charm and is short for “charisma”, reports Daily Mail."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
