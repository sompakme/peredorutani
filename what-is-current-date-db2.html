 Answer
THE CURRENT DATE It is possible to provide a date using the CURRENT DATE special register, which is based on a reading of the time-of-day clock when the SQL query is performed on the currently connected server. For other applications, the date is generated by the DB2®, which executes the SQL statement that references to the special register and returns the value of the register."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

A timestamp value is composed of seven components: the year, the month, the day, the hour, the minute, the second, and, if applicable, the fractional second.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>One could also wonder, what is the current date and time.</h3><p>the current date and time The term “current date” refers to the date that is now in effect or the date on which something will take place. For example, the following is a formal approach to inquire about today’s date with someone: When you submit anything, such as a form or an application, you are referring to the following date: When you fill out the form, you must provide the date that is currently in effect.</p><p></p><h3>How long has it been since the year 2019 began?</h3><p>365 days a year</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>There were 12 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>How many days have elapsed since the last update?</h3><p>46 days are left on the clock.</p><p></p><h3>What is the Julian date on this particular day?</h3><p>The current date is Tuesday, February 29, 2020.

To enter the current date, use Ctrl+; to remove the current date, press Ctrl+; (semi-colon). To input the current time, use Ctrl+Shift+; to enter the date, press Ctrl+Shift+; (semi-colon). For example, to enter the current date and time, press Ctrl+; (semi-colon), followed by Space, and then Ctrl+Shift+; (semi-colon).</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What day of the week is it today in 2019?</h3><p>Day numbers are important.

In addition, timestamps are less taxing on the database and are indexed more quickly. When you require values that include both date and time information, the DATETIME type is what you want to use. YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS is the format used by MySQL for retrieving and displaying DATETIME data.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-153 data-inserter-version=2></span> <span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span> <span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span> <span class=post-views-count>8</span><br>Spread the love<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FEq6upp5mjwW%2BvzqZma2hiZ3xxfo6wn5qsXZ7Abq%2FUq6mepqRisaLAxGabm2pencGuuA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-thomas.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Thomas</span></a>
