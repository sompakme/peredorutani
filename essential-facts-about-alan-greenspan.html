In his book, "<a href=#>Maestro</a>," Bob Woodward commented on how Greenspan's parent's divorce caused him to move with his mother to Upper Manhattan and live with his grandparents. The new home brought him close to the Polo Grounds, which was not difficult for children to get in for free to see the Giants years before their switch to San Francisco.</p><p dir=ltr>But Greenspan admitted in his memoir, "<a href=#>The Age of Turbulence</a>," that even though he couldn't watch their games as much, he zealously followed the Yankees in the newspapers. By the time he was 9 years old, he dreamed of becoming a professional ballplayer. He wrote, "I played on neighborhood teams, and I was pretty good — I'm a lefty, and I had the agility and reflexes to make a solid first baseman." Others took notice of his skills as well and one senior even told Greenspan he was on track to play for a major league team in the future.</p><p dir=ltr>Unfortunately, his steady improvement didn't last, for Greenspan then added, "But that is the very moment at which my progress stopped. I never fielded or hit as well after that season. I'd peaked at 14." On the other hand, baseball led to the boy's fascination with batting averages, which helped him to fully grasp fractions at a young age.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9j21ucWxhZLK0v8Snq6KZnGKzoq%2FTrGSamp%2BqwW6ty5qlZp%2BimrKvv8%2BapWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clip-of-jack-dylan-grazer-smoking-weed-surfaces-online-after-luca-star-mocks-getting-cancelled-o.html><span>←</span><span>Clip of Jack Dylan Grazer smoking weed surfaces online after &amp;quot;Luca&amp;quot; star mocks getting 'cancelled' o</span></a>
