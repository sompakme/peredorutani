Danielle "Bhad Bhabie" Bregoli is literally sixteen-years-old, still a child, and it is not appropriate to be trying to get with her. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The rising star has been criticized this week because of her transformation, being accused of getting plastic surgery</a>. While her lips do appear to be larger than before, Bhabie is attributing her changes to puberty, reminding people that she's a teenager and her body is still changing. We're sure that, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">as Rubi Rose admitted to us</a>, Bhad Bhabie probably gets some weirdos in her direct messages and she went ahead and exposed one of them, calling out Adrien Broner for having the nerve to hit her up.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Text me crazy girl," allegedly wrote Adrien Broner to Bhad Bhabie. For added context, Broner is thirty-years-old, texting a girl nearly half his age. Bhad Bhabie isn't exactly down with what he's doing so she decided to put him on blast, leaking the message and issuing a cryptic&nbsp;addition in her next slide. Posting the "Locked Up" video from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Akon</a>, Bhabie appears to be sending a message to the boxer, telling him that if he continues to shoot his shot, she'll make sure he goes to jail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiaIN6hJFmmaGZlGKvqa3BopxmnailvLSx0maYnaqZmrturtGopZ6qo2Kxrr%2BMpqCgoKRir6Z506uwoqaXYsGwecaeq2agmaJ6rbvCpJydZaWleq%2Bx1qw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aaron-goodwin-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Aaron Goodwin Net Worth 2024</span></a>
