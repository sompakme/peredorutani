And this year’s lineup, while scaled back in scope, is certain to attract plenty of buzz with a film from director <a href=# id=auto-tag_lena-dunham_1 data-tag=lena-dunham>Lena Dunham</a> to a pair of <a href=# id=auto-tag_dakota-johnson_1 data-tag=dakota-johnson>Dakota Johnson</a> star vehicles to one of the final performances of <a href=#>Michael K.

Last year’s iteration was virtual due to the COVID pandemic and featured a smaller lineup. The 2022 iteration will take place in person in Utah, with online offerings for those not traveling, and with a strict vaccination requirement in place for festivalgoers. As with the 2021 fest, the 2022 lineup is smaller than lineups were pre-pandemic and features only 10 films in its U.S. Dramatic Competition section as opposed to the typical 16.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Among the films in the U.S. Dramatic Competition is 892, which will see the late Williams share the screen with John Boyega, as well as Cha Cha Real Smooth, starring Johnson as a young mother with an autistic daughter (the latter features the breakout performance of actress Vanessa Burghardt, who is on the autism spectrum). Johnson also pops up in the Premieres section with Am I OK? from directors (and married couple) Stephanie Allynne and Tig Notaro.</p><p>Dunham, who launched her career with the indie Tiny Furniture, returns to directing with Sharp Stick, which she wrote, directed and co-stars in alongside Kristine Froseth, Jon Bernthal, Scott Speedman, Taylour Paige and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The film will bow in the festival’s Salt Lake City Opening Night section.</p><p>Sundance often reflects the current news cycle, and this year is no different, with several films centering on abortion and women’s health. The Documentary Competition section includes The Janes, which focuses on the 1972 arrest of seven women that built an underground network to get women safe abortions, while the Premieres section has Carol screenwriter Phyllis Nagy’s Call Jane, which stars Elizabeth Banks and Sigourney Weaver and follows a 1960s housewife who seeks to offer women access to abortions.</p><p>“We don’t program along thematic lines, but we did notice some trends coming out as we are going through our submissions, which were quite robust,” festival director of programming Kim Yutani tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I think we saw filmmakers reacting to this time that we’ve all experienced the past 18-20 months and just seeing how artists are processing the world that we’ve been living in and how that has affected them telling their stories. I think there’s a certain kind of introspective quality to the films, and they are really calling into question systems and institutions.”</p><p>Frequently a launching pad for splashy biodoc premieres, Sundance’s past nonfiction selections include films about Taylor Swift, Jane Fonda and Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Among this year’s batch is the highly anticipated Netflix doc jeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy, which tracks the life and career of Kanye West, as well as The Princess, a look at the late Princess Diana that is certain to spark the wrath of the royal family. Elsewhere in the varied nonfiction slate is a feature about a group of Al-Qaeda members transferred to a secretive rehabilitation center for Islamic extremists and a deep-dive on the rise and prominence of TikTok. And among the projects most likely to generate headlines is W. Kamau Bell’s Bill Cosby docuseries We Need to Talk About Cosby.</p><p>“It’s an incredibly kind of forensic analysis — socially, politically and culturally — about what was going on through that incredible trajectory of Cosby as an iconic figure in U.S. mass entertainment and then as a notorious figure in terms of sexual assault and rape,” Jackson notes. “A number of films in this year’s program use history as a lens to understand ourselves now and also what might be possible.”</p><p>The Robert Reford-founded fest has commited to creating more gender and racial equity in the programming of its lineup. This year, 60 percent (or 6 out of 10) of the directors behind the films in this year’s U.S. Dramatic Competition identify as women, while 50 percent identify as people of color. Of all the feature films in the festival, of which there are 82, 43 were directed by one or more filmmakers that identify as women (one was directed by one or more filmmakers who identify as nonbinary), while 29 titles were directed by one or more filmmakers who identify as people of color.</p><p>The 2022 Sundance Film Festival will run from Jan. 20-30 in and around Park City.</p><p>See the full Sundance lineup below.</p><p><strong>U.S. DRAMATIC COMPETITION</strong></p><p>892 / U.S.A.
