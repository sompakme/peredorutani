At the age of 14, he became a member of the New Orleans rap group Hot Boys with members Juvenile, B.G. and Turk.

The purchase doesn't seem strange at first glance, right? Well, remember: Wanye bought the car two years before he was legally able to drive it. Heck, he wasn't even allowed to participate in his home state's driver education course in Louisiana, because&nbsp;<a href=#>in 1996</a> one had to be at least 15 years old to enroll.&nbsp;</p><p>The Southern-raised wordsmith mentioned that Nissan in his song <a href=#>"Russian Roulette,"</a> off his Funeral (Deluxe) album, released on Jan. 31, 2020. "I was servin' it, like Anna Kournikova/From a Nissan Pathfinder, now I have to find a chauffeur," he rapped.
