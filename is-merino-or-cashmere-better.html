Cashmere does not contain lanolin, so it's an entirely hypoallergenic alternative to merino and other fibres. However, cashmere is a natural yarn and this can cause mild irritation for some people.<h2>Is cashmere too hot for summer?</h2>Cashmere fabric features properties that make it suitable even for the hottest months. Being a natural fabric, it's able to maintain consistent body temperature by allowing our skin to breath. The thermally insulating fibres absorb perspiration and expel it in the form of vapour, keeping us cool.<h2>What is the highest quality wool?</h2>Merino wool is the highest quality wool, sourced from a breed of sheep called Merino.
