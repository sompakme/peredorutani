That is just the way of the television and movie world these days. If something had a nice run in a previous decade then we are going to see what it looks like in a modern version almost for sure. Such is the case with Doogie Howser which is getting a <a href=#>makeover</a> for a current audience. The new series which is coming soon to Disney+ is getting a Hawaiian theme to it and a new title song and sequence to boot.&nbsp;</p><p>This new Doogie Howser reboot is titled Doogie Kamealoha M.D. and will follow Lahela “‘Doogie” Kameāloha as she journeys her prodigy-level ascension to medical doctor as only a teenager. In a lot of ways, it looks much like the original show in terms of setup and delivery, giving Lahela a position at a local hospital after completing her medical credentials in near-record time. But unlike the original show, this one will have more of an island vibe. <a href=#>Check out</a> the new theme song for the Doogie Howser reboot and see how it <a href=#>compares</a> to the original.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The sound of the theme is the same as the original Doogie Howser though it replaces the late-80s computer electronic sound with the island ukelele picking and just an overall breeziness. There is a lot of overlap in the visuals, detailing the meteoric rise for Lahela, blowing through high school in nine weeks on her way to actually practicing medicine in a local hospital. By comparison, here is the original <a href=#>theme song</a> for Doogie Howser with Neil Patrick Harris in the starring role:&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>This new Doogie Howser reboot will star Peyton Elizabeth Lee in the titular role and Jason Scott Lee will play Benny, her father. Other notables include Kathleen Rose Perkins as another doctor in the hospital and Jeffrey Bower-Chapman as well. It is sure to take a comedic and sometimes heartwarming approach to an unlikely scenario: a genius teenager taking over the reins of a medical practice in a local hospital. The theme is cute enough and played fine back when the original show came out.&nbsp;</p><p>Dodge Howser, M.D. <a href=#>first premiered</a> back in 1989 and was the breakout role for a young <a href=#>Neil Patrick Harris</a> at the time. He played the good doctor who becomes the youngest practitioner in the country at the age of just 14. The show had standard teen sitcom themes of friendship and young love with the backdrop of Doogie having to deal with the pressures of being a doctor. This show was often punctuated by Doogie recording some life lessons he learned in his computer diary.&nbsp;</p><p>Doogie Howser ran for four seasons on ABC before it was ultimately canceled in 1993, falling just short of 100 episodes. It was created by Steven Bochco and David E. Kelly. The two had worked on L.A. Law together and have had unbelievably successful careers in the network space throughout the years. It will be interesting to see how this reboot shakes out. Doogie Kamealoha M.D. is scheduled to hit Disney+ on September 8th.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2icn6S0qrGMoaawq5WnerOxwaimrWaYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pete-davidson-s-dating-history-from-kim-kardashian-to-chase-sui-wonders.html><span>←</span><span>Pete Davidson's dating history: From Kim Kardashian to Chase Sui Wonders</span></a>
