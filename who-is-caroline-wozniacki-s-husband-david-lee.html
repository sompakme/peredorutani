After a successful college career, Lee was drafted by&nbsp;the New York Knicks in&nbsp;2005. With the team, Lee recorded many remarkable career milestones, including in 2010, when he became the first Knick to make the All-Star in nine years, per <a href=#>The New York Times</a>. After five seasons with The Knicks, Lee signed with the Golden State Warriors, where he was once again picked to be a part of the All-Star team. With the Warriors, Lee racked up even more success,&nbsp;averaging 16.7 points and 9.6 rebounds, according to <a href=#>ESPN</a>. With the Warriors, Lee also won the first and only championship of his NBA career.</p><p>Between 2015 when he left the Warriors, and 2017, Lee played for the Boston Celtics, the Dallas Mavericks, and San Antonio Spurs. And then, in November 2017, after 12 years of playing basketball professionally, Lee announced his retirement. "His career speaks for itself: 2015 NBA CHAMPION 2 time ALL STAR 2 team captain More than 11,000 career points Over 7000 rebounds," a proud Caroline Wozniacki wrote in a heartwarming <a href=#>Instagram</a> tribute&nbsp;celebrating Lee's retirement. "Most importantly, why I am so proud of him, is because of the person he is, and how he has carried himself throughout his career. Dave, you are such an inspiration, not only to me, but to all the people around you! I love you so much and can't wait to see where this next chapter takes us," she added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtibYV2g46cmKunnJ67pnnWqLGnoZGYuKp5x66qm5memXqlrdWim2aklZp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-chemical-exfoliant-is-right-for-you.html><span>←</span><span>What Chemical Exfoliant Is Right for You?</span></a>
