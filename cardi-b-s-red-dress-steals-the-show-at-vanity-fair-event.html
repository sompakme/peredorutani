Moreover, she wore a beautiful red dress with matching lipstick and a stream behind her as she strode down the red carpet. Also, she paired the gown with what seem to be silver heels, plus a sheer see-through headpiece that covered her whole face. Overall, it was a beautiful look, and one that viewers unfortunately missed on Oscars night amid so many other celebrities. What's more is that her husband <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Offset</a> also appeared alongside her, wearing a simple but elegant black tuxedo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, the two are probably enjoying the success of their new McDonald's meal and merchandising line. However, it hasn't been all apple pies and Oreo McFlurry sweetness for the two new fast-food moguls. Many of the restaurant's franchises <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">refuse to promote the meal</a>, as their managers believe Cardi and the former Migo don't align with the company's values. Still, the partnership's brought both parties a lot of success and crossover attention, so they're looking at the big picture over the minute details.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cardi-b-takes-over-vanity-fair-s-oscar-party-in-style>Cardi B Takes Over Vanity Fair's Oscar Party In Style</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In other news, the Invasion Of Privacy MC also made headlines recently thanks to a seemingly squashed rap beef. While she didn't do anything herself, the discussion came from fellow rapper BIA, who denied "switching up" on Cardi recently. Furthermore, she responded to people saying that she deleted her tweets praising Cardi when she was hanging out with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>. Those two have a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">significant beef</a>, and so many accused BIA of taking a side by deleting her love for the "WAP" star.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Keep it 100,” BIA began. “Sweetie, I didn’t switch up on anybody because I don’t know Cardi in real life. I’ve never met Cardi, we’ve never had a conversation. Like, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I don’t have no issues with her</a>, it’s all love, but I don’t know her." Still, many fans didn't buy it, although that could just be a general online thirst for beef. It's unfortunate that they're pitted against each other, but at least Cardi's big red carpet smile and cheeky exclamation of "I'm so scared!" hints that she's paying it no mind.
