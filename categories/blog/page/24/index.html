Summer don't know me no more
Eager man, that's allSummer don't know me
He just let me love in myself
Cause I do know love
From you that
Just died, yeah
I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine
Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see
Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight
