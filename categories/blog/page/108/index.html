Verse 1
Master, the tempest is raging.
The billows are tossing high.
The sky is o'er shadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh.
Carest Thou not that we perish?
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatning,
A grave in the angry deep?Chorus
The winds and the waves
Shall obey my will, peace be still.
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Aaron Goodwin Net Worth 2024</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>

If you're trying to shoot your shot on Bhad Bhabie, we'd like to extend a friendly word of advice: don't.

The rising star has been criticized this week because of her transformation, being accused of getting plastic surgery. While her lips do appear to be larger than before, Bhabie is attributing her changes to puberty, reminding people that she's a teenager and her body is still changing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bluebottles on Queensland beaches: Thousands of people stung</h2><time>Jul 19, 2024</time>
