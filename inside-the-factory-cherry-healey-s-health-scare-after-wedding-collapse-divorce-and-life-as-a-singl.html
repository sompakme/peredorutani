We'd been married for six years and together for eight and suddenly it felt like throwing my life up in the air and waiting to see where it landed.</p><p>"It involves so much sorting out of finances, a home; so you can't crumble. You have to be strong, yet inside your heart's breaking and it's intensely painful.</p><p>"I had loads of work on and had to keep my emotions in a box until the evenings when I would just sob and sob and have chocolate snacks in the early hours of the morning."</p><p>After the breakup though, Cherry started weekly therapy sessions and credits that along with socialising and regular exercise as her key to staying on top of her mental health.</p><p>In the same interview she also spoke about the challenges she had to adapt to as a single parent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article22403444.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS205987620.jpg><p>She said: "At first I really pushed myself to be on top of their homework, made sure I saw all their school letters, and their uniform was smart. I thought, 'Why am I going the extra mile?' and realised it was because I didn't want people to have any reason to judge me.</p><p>"There's this totally wrong social stigma around single parenting which I hope will eventually disappear. I'm happy I was a good parent when I was married, and I'm still just as good a parent now I'm single."</p><p>Cherry has also spoken about a health scare she had back in 2009 to the <a href=# rel=follow>Express</a>.</p><p>While at a friend's wedding, Cherry knew she had a urinary tract infection (UTI) and had suffered them regularly since age 12, but she wasn't aware of how serious they can be.</p><p>"I had left it far too long,” she said recalling the day. “I was mainlining painkillers and in a real state, sweating and feeling shaky but I just carried on and went to the wedding as I didn’t want to let anyone down.”</p><p>She managed to walk up the aisle as a bridesmaid but couldn't eat anything and later collapsed on a bed where her then husband found her and took her home.</p><p>"By the Sunday I was sheet white, had a terrible migraine and felt like death, so finally took myself to A&E. They admitted me instantly and I was in hospital for five days.”</p><p>By this point the UTI had actually spread to Cherry's kidneys and doctors were very concerned by her blood tests.</p><p>“They did an ultrasound and discovered because I had left it so long, my kidneys were permanently damaged; they will always be scarred from the infection.”</p><p>She says she now takes UTIs much more seriously, acting as soon as she notices symptoms.</p><p><b><i>Want more of the latest London news sent straight to your inbox?
