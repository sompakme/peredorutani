During an interview with Cam Capone News this week, <a href=# rel>the embattled performer</a> said that he "created" the Illuminati. According to him, that's why he takes offense to people "devaluing" it.</p><p>"It angers me cuz I created it," he says in a clip from the interview. When asked to clarify his statement, Brown doubled down. "If I'm Jesus I would think I did [create it], yeah," he explained. The interviewer proceeded to press him for more details, which Brown was initially hesitant to share. "Not my place to. You guys know," he stated. He went on to mention <a href=# class=text-word rel>Diddy</a>, however, making some disturbing claims about the Bad Boy Records founder's <a href=# rel>sexual assault allegations</a>.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Orlando Brown Claims That Tupac & Keefe D Are The Same Person: Watch</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-orlando-brown-s-bizarre-interview>Orlando Brown's Bizarre Interview</h2></span><p>"You know Diddy, one of my best friends?" he began. "So when you want to be a Kappa and you get hazed, didn't you want to be a Kappa? [...] We're gonna haze you and haze you and haze you until you are a f*cking Kappa. That's what happened. People sold their souls to Diddy, and then they're mad now because the hazing process was a little bit rougher than they thought." These are far from the first <a href=# rel>bizarre statements</a> Brown has made, however.</p><p>Back in October, the LA native said that Tupac and his accused killer, Keefe D, are <a href=# rel>actually the same person</a>. "He is Tupac," he declared blankly. "Can't arrest him if he's the man that died!"&nbsp;What do you think of Orlando Brown's recent interview? What about his disturbing comments on Diddy's sexual assault allegations? Do you think he really "created" the Illuminati?
