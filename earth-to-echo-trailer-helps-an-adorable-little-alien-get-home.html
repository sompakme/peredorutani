To the best of my knowledge, however, there hasn’t been a found footage sci-fi kids movie, until now that is. Relativity is set to release their kid-centric <i><a href=#>Earth to Echo</a></i> later this summer, and it definitely fits into this category. Shortly after the announcement that the film will premiere at the <a href=#>Los Angeles Film Festival</a> in mid-June, the studio has unveiled a quick new trailer and a handful of still photos.</p><p>At a few seconds over a minute, <a href=#>this trailer</a> is on the shorter side of things, but does a good job of cramming in most of the important plot points. When a trio of friends, played by Teo Halm, Reese Hartwig, and a kid whose name is Astro, receive strange messages on their cell phones—because all kids need and have cell phones—they team up to investigate the mysterious goings on. A map sent to all of three of the boys leads them out to a remote spot in the desert—where are their parents in all of this, letting them be lured to remote locations by unknown parties? Once there they come across an adorable little being from space named Echo. Because Echo is from space, the government tries to hunt it down, and it is up to the friends hide it and help it get home.<span id=more-96447></span></p><p>Story wise and thematically anyway, <i>Earth to Echo</i> definitely owes a large debt to <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>’s beloved classic <i><a href=#>E.T.</a></i>. There are also notes of both <i><a href=#>Explorers</a></i> and <i><a href=#>Super 8</a></i> as well.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/earth-to-echo-exclusive-images-01.jpg alt="Earth to Echo" width=578 height=386 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The new photos come from Just Jared, and show a variety of the stages from the movie.
