He was my godmother and the first person to expose me to a lot of the music and culture that serve as inspiration for this album," Beyoncé wrote in the note to fans. "Thank you to all of the pioneers who originate culture, to all of the fallen angels whose contributions have gone unrecognized for far too long. This is a celebration for you."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dedicated members of the Beyhive know, however, that Renaissance isn't the first time Beyoncé has mentioned her late uncle and his influence on her career.

Later He was my nanny / housekeeper / designer / Dance partner / confident and bestie," Knowles-Lawson wrote. "I laughed constantly with him and trusted him unconditionally! When he died a piece of me went with him. Solange and Beyoncé worshiped him. He helped me raise them. And influenced their sense of style and uniqueness!"</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">She honored Jonny during her and Jay-Z's GLAAD Vanguard Award acceptance speech in 2019.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He was brave and unapologetic during a time when this country wasn't as accepting. Witnessing his battle with HIV was one of the most painful experiences I've ever lived," she said. "I'm hopeful that his struggle served to open pathways for other young people to live more freely. LGBTQI rights are human rights."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">He helped design Beyoncé's costumes early on in her career—he even made her prom dress.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Knowles-Lawson revealed in her dedication post to Jonny that he assisted her in helping build the early wardrobes of Beyoncé and Destiny's Child, including making Bey's own prom dress. Beyoncé even gave a verbal nod to her relative in her song "Heated," with the lyrics, "Uncle Jonny made my dress / That cheap spandex, she looks a mess."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">He introduced Beyoncé to the world of house music.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyoncé shared that her Uncle Jonny introduced her to the music that would go on to inspire Renaissance, but her mother also reiterated the same sentiment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Johnny loved house music!
