Moreover, it looks like his next creative project is actually a particularly themed house behind his estate, and it shows off his comic book nerd side. The Baton Rouge rapper gave a massive and lengthy tour of his "Batman Mansion," which is decorated with various artwork depicting the Caped Crusader, The Joker, Catwoman, and other World's Greatest Detective-related content. He seemed very excited to share this with fans, as it's a side that we don't usually get to see from him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Most of the time, when Boosie is uploading long videos to social media, it's either his livestreams on IG or something to do with some beef that he's in. Currently, that's his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sample clearance issues</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rod Wave</a>, although based on the Florida singer and rapper's response, it looks like it might disappear soon. Although we don't know how deep the 41-year-old really is when it comes to Batman's comic book world, we have to salute the dedication. He's the kind of superhero that even the most casual of readers can get into very passionately.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-watch-boosie-s-tour-of-his-batman-mansion>Watch Boosie's Tour Of His "Batman Mansion"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another big aspect of the Trill Entertainment affiliate's public presence these days is an unfortunate passed opportunity. While speaking to The Breakfast Club, he explained why his collab album with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>T.I.</a> didn't end up manifesting into a reality. "I called him about a month ago and asked him what’s up with it," Boosie recalled. "I think it’s just, like, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">on the back-burner right now</a>. It’s damn near done, bro. I think I’m more excited on driving it than Tip. You know, Tip locked in with these movies, but man, me and Tip made a hell of an album. I just f***ed it up."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, it's always kind of wild to see him switch between comments on his career like these and things like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">NBA referees' obsession with giving out technical fouls</a>. No matter what the Louisiana native is talking about, big or small, there's always some hot take or vivid perspective afoot. Let's see if his next architectural aspirations lead him to an Aquaman pool or a Spider-Man-themed basketball court.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnaIN4fZhmmaino56ybq7AraSapl2irq%2B%2FyKilZqyfqr9uwsidnKhlmJ69brTOqWSnnaeo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alineaciones-probables-para-la-jornada-14-de-laliga-ea-sports.html><span>←</span><span>Alineaciones probables para la jornada 14 de LaLiga EA Sports</span></a>
