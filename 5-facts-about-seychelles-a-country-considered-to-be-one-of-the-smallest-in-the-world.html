Over 99,000 population</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Worlddometer</a> gathers that the current population of the African country is pegged at 99,080. It should be noted that this could, however, change as it is a live update.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?

Its trade sector</h3><p class=align-left>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Commonwealth</a>, the international organisation helped the country with its World Trade Organisation reform and related disputes. Not only that, emerging trade issues with other countries were also resolved.</p><h2>3. Many islands</h2><p class=align-left>Perhaps this is why tourists love the country so much. Seychelles is made up of more than 100 islands. The country shares boundaries with Kenya and Madagascar. The islands are grouped into two. One set is rocky and mountainous, while the other is described as very low-lying.</p><h2>4. Five-year term for president</h2><p class=align-left>Unlike the Nigerian term of office, the president of Seychelles is elected to occupy office for five years through popular votes. They also have a single legislature house.</p><h2>5. British colonized Seychelles</h2><p class=align-left>The country gained its independence from Britain in 1976 and straightaway became a republic. Its agricultural sector has been growing exponentially ever since.</p><h2>Nigeria's population warning</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile,<strong> Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that a former Nigerian president, <a href=#>Olusegun Obasanjo</a>, warned that Nigeria’s population may soon <a href=#>become a problem if not managed properly</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/66c5f565bd721114.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top ten richest countries on the African continent in 2018</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It was gathered that Obasanjo gave the warning in Abeokuta, the <a href=#>Ogun state</a> capital on Sunday, June 27, during a discussion with students of some selected schools across the country.</p><p class=align-left>He advised Nigerian leaders to prepare for and against population explosion to avoid challenges in the future.
