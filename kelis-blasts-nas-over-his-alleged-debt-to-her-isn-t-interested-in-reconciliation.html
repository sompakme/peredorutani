Moreover, she responded to some Instagram comments involving the New York rapper, making it clear that she's not interested in burying the hatchet. "NAS & Kelis y'all need to double back, give love another chance. Blessings," one fan wrote. "Stop, it was 15 years ago. Do you want your ex from almost 2 decades ago?" the singer-songwriter and chef clapped back. Then, in another comment, she made the specific claim about Esco owing her money.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Give Nas his bread back," another user commented to Kelis. "Lol he owes me actually, get outa her [sic] only a loser is worried about somebody else's money lol please," she retorted in her reply. Of course, the Manhattan native has a lot of other things to worry about apart from the money that Nas allegedly owes her. For example, she also <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">got into it with the Beyhive</a> back in 2022 due to Beyoncé sampling her on the RENAISSANCE cut "ENERGY," which opened up the can of worms around her publishing rights once more.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kelis-claims-nas-owes-her-money-amp-dismisses-the-idea-of-a-reconciliation>Kelis Claims Nas Owes Her Money & Dismisses The Idea Of A Reconciliation</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for the Nas situation, it's unclear whether Kelis is referring to some music industry-related dealings or the couple's previous <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">custody battle</a> over their son. That was a pretty nasty back-and-forth in court, albeit one that seems mostly resolved at this point since not much else has come out about it. Hopefully things are at least clear and amicable behind the scenes and in the family dynamic even if some bad blood remains. If nothing else, it seems like she has more to say about what went down here, but chose not to get into it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, their relationship ended on a serious and damning note as <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kelis accused Nas of abuse</a>, which he denied. This all went down years ago, and there's no telling whether these Instagram comments will reopen parts of that conversation. However, it doesn't seem like something they couldn't resolve privately, so here's hoping that goes well. After all, the Kaleidoscope artist faced a lot of hardships and injustices already in the game.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZn5xfJZmop6kmah6r63SZqawnaNiurC6xLJknZ2SqXqzsdKppqerlWK1qryMoaapZZ6axLQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-warden-s-biography-age-height-boyfriend-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Wardens biography: age, height, boyfriend, net worth</span></a>
