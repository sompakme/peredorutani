However, her change in looks took a lot of time to perfect. During her time in NXT, Ripley sported long hair and lacked any of the punk rock aesthetics that she has now.</p><p>Rhea Ripley cut off her long hair back in 2018 and it seems that was the best decision of her career. A Rhea Ripley fan account recently posted an old picture of Ripley on Instagram, where Ripley could be seen sporting long hair.</p><p>The caption asked what would have happened had Rhea Ripley kept her long hair. Rhea Ripley decided to comment on the post as she simply stated that she would have been fired by WWE had Ripley not cut her long hair.</p><p>Rhea Ripley is currently one half of the Women’s Tag Team Champions along with Nikki A.S.H. It is safe to say Ripley is having a great time as a tag team and we will have to wait and see what is next in store for her.</p><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
