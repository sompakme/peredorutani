In interrogation tapes obtained by <a href=# title=_self>ABC News</a>, Jodi said she didn’t hurt him. “If Travis were here today, he would tell me that it wasn’t me.” She added, “If I was going to ever try to kill somebody, I would use gloves. I have plenty of them.” And finally, “I don’t think I could stab him. I think I would have to shoot him.”</p><h2>How did Jodi kill her boyfriend?</h2><p>The 30-year-old Morman businessman was stabbed 27 times, his throat was slit so far he was nearly decapitated, and he was shot in the head.</p><h2>How many years did Jodi get?</h2><p>In 2015, Jodi was <a href=#>sentenced to natural life in prison</a> after two juries could not reach a unanimous decision on whether or not to sentence her to death. Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens could have given her life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years but ultimately chose a harsher sentence. After the announcement, the victim’s sister, Tanisha Sorenson, shouted, “Burn in hell!” Jodi is currently incarcerated at Arizona State Prison Complex – Perryville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJorqGxXZm2pXnJqJuiZZGntqK%2FjKSgpaRdnbKzecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXmQbmhsb2lk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-toothpaste-helps-rebuild-gums.html><span>←</span><span>What toothpaste helps rebuild gums?</span></a></nav></article></main><footer class=footer><p>&copy; 2024 <a href=./></a></p><p>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Hugo️️</a>️</p></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
