In a previous interview with Collider, the subject of favorites was brought up amongst the cast of&nbsp;One Piece, and the actress dove right in. “My favorite anime is called&nbsp;Made in Abyss,&nbsp;but I love&nbsp;<a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Demon Slayer" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked href=# rel=noopener>Demon Slayer</a>, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Tokyo Ghoul.&nbsp;I’ve watched too many to name them all,” Rudd said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/made-in-abyss-2-900x506.jpg><p>Although&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;may not hold the number one spot in Emily Rudd’s heart, it is evident that the anime remains dear to her. After the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Netflix data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Netflix</a> live-action series release, she took to social media to express her gratitude, describing playing Nami as “her dream.” This heartfelt message is a testament to her affection for the role and the series.</p><p><a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="One Piece" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>One Piece</a>&nbsp;has been a highly popular, long-running Japanese anime and manga long before it became a Netflix show. Created by Eiichiro Oda, the series debuted in Shueisha’s Weekly Shonen Jump magazine in July 1997 and has since become one of the most successful and beloved <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=franchises data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>franchises</a> in the world of anime and manga.</p><p><strong>“As a Hollywood production, the action and the VFX are great, not to mention the performance by the cast… But above all, I want to call attention to how perfect the Straw Hat cast are. It’s like you’re watching the straw hats in real life.”</strong></p>-Eiichiro Oda, creator of One Piece<p>One Piece follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate who can stretch his body like rubber after eating Devil Fruit. Luffy sets out on a journey to find the ultimate treasure known as the “One Piece” and become the Pirate King. Along the way, he gathers a crew called the Straw Hat Pirates, each with their own unique abilities and dreams.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/made-in-abyss-900x507.jpg><p>The series is set in a vast, richly detailed world made up of different islands, oceans, and cultures. Throughout the&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;series, Luffy and his crew encounter formidable adversaries, including the Marines, other pirate crews, and the Seven Warlords of the Sea. One of the most iconic antagonists is Gol D. Roger, the previous Pirate King, whose legacy plays a significant role in the story.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Netflix’s</a> live-action adaptation of&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;has become a resounding success. The series presently boasts an impressive 96 percent audience approval rating based on over 10,000 viewer ratings on <a href=#>Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The critical rating stands firm at 83 percent, according to 41 <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=reviews data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>reviews</a> to date.</p><p>“<strong>My favorite anime is called&nbsp;Made in Abyss,&nbsp;but I love&nbsp;Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Tokyo Ghoul.&nbsp;I’ve watched too many to name them all.</strong>“</p>-Emily Rudd<p>Considering Netflix’s less-than-stellar history with anime adaptations,&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;manages to capture the very essence of its source material. This accomplishment can be attributed to daring artistic choices and a cast of characters that leave a profound and lasting impression. This achievement challenges the prevailing belief that live-action anime and manga adaptations are destined for failure.</p><p>Days before its release,&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;creator Eiichiro Oda offered high praise for the production. In a video shared through the show’s official Instagram account, Oda said, “As a Hollywood production, the action and the VFX are great, not to mention the performance by the cast,” he added, “But above all, I want to call attention to how perfect the Straw Hat cast are. It’s like you’re watching the straw hats in real life.”</p><p>Oda, known for his somewhat reclusive nature, didn’t hesitate to communicate his desired changes to the Netflix team during production.&nbsp;One Piece&nbsp;director Emma Sullivan previously shared insights into Oda’s involvement, explaining that he would request reshoots and alterations to the script if something didn’t align with his creative standards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2innpp6sbXEnJxmnZ2eubp50a6bnWWRl8a0v42hq6ak</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mike-epps-suggests-ice-cube-makes-new-friday-movie-amid-katt-williams-drama.html><span>←</span><span>Mike Epps Suggests Ice Cube Makes New &amp;quot;Friday&amp;quot; Movie Amid Katt Williams Drama</span></a>
