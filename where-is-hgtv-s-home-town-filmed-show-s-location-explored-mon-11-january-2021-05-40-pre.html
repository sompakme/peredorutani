The city was selected from a number of other options.</p><p>Erin and Ben thought Wetumpka would be perfect for their show because the city needed “some structural and aesthetic enhancements.” They further added that they wish to bring “new hope and inspiration to an entire community.”</p><p>Erin and Ben revealed they changed the location because they wanted to step away from their usual. At the same time, the pair wanted to bring joy into the lives of others. Erin and Ben follow their mission “of helping to establish and foster a town’s persona that draws on its roots, history, resources, and traditions.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=ben-and-erin-react-to-renovating-a-small-town>Ben and Erin react to renovating a small town:</h3><p>The pair opened up about their new project while talking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HGTV</a>. “Renovating one house at a time is an awesome experience.
