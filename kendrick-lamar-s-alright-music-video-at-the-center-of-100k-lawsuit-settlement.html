The suit claims that in 2020 a teacher in a Connecticut middle school showed a documentary called Hip Hop: Songs That Shook America in their class. The video for "Alright" is included in the doc. A student with a parent who is a police officer claims that watching it caused them emotional distress. The claim argues that "the video depicted officers as murderers and contained other shockingly violent scenes and controversial statements about police officers." The town is now settling the lawsuit and paying $100k as a part of the settlement.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kendrick-lamar-s-alright-video-leads-to-lawsuit>Kendrick Lamar's "Alright" Video Leads To Lawsuit</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Kendrick Lamar's beef with Drake</a> dominated the past month in hip-hop.
