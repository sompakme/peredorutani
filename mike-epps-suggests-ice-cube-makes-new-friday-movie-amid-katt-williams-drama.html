I wrote one, it was the sh*t. They was like, ‘Yo, we don’t want Craig and Day-Day in jail, ’cause Craig and Day-Day went to jail for selling weed before it was legal! Then after they rejected it they had all these f*cking movies about going to jail: Orange Is The New Black… Get Hard. So then I wrote another script, and the script was really about … the youngsters in the hood having beef with the OG’s in the hood and Craig has to come back and squash that because Smokey’s son is the new Deebo and he’s wylin! They tripped on it, man. They f*cked around and then John Witherspoon passed. Then Deebo passed … they just f*cked it up.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mike-epps-plea-for-another-friday-movie>Mike Epps' Plea For Another "Friday" Movie</h2></span><p>Ice Cube also responded to Katt Williams' in a lengthy video on social media by <a href=# rel>clearing up several “discrepancies</a>.” Be on the lookout for further updates on Mike Epps on HotNewHipHop.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Ice Cube Reacts To Fake Report About "Friday" Prequel Starring Druski & Vince Staples</a></strong></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnan56fJBmpKKjlWKysbzSZqqun5eawLW%2FjKKanmWTqq%2Bmecyaop6rXaOyuHnFq6CdmaliurDCyJ5kmqWZmXqsrdOtZLChnKG2ornSZpurmZ2W</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./heidi-gardner-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html><span>←</span><span>Heidi Gardner Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
