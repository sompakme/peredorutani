Harris has spoken publicly about her close bond with her stepkids and how much Cole and Ella mean to her.

Children need consistency; I didn’t want to insert myself into their lives as a temporary fixture because I didn’t want to disappoint them. There’s nothing worse than disappointing a child."</strong></p><p>But she needn't have worried. The initial meeting went well, and Harris fell in love with the two kids. She was nervous at first and wanting to make a good first impression she "picked up a tin of cookies and tied a ribbon in a bow around them," but worried they might find the gesture "weird" or "too much." They loved it.</p><p>"Cole and Ella could not have been more welcoming. They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe it was Cole and Ella who reeled me in."</p><h2 id=now-cole-and-ella-are-an-important-part-of-her-life-3>Now, Cole and Ella are an important part of her life.</h2><p>Emhoff and Harris officially got married in 2015.

"I think for all of us, it was love at first sight. We had an incredible evening at one of my favorite restaurants—The Reel Inn. We had a long drive down the Pacific Coast Highway, sharing music. I got to know her first on a much more personal level—her music tastes, her cooking, how she interacts with Doug, which was hilarious. She would just be ribbing him. It was perfect," said Cole. "Over time, I got a sense of who she was and her career up to that point. It gave me a new understanding of what she's been able to accomplish, and I was so impressed."</p><a href=# data-model-name="'The Truths We Hold' by Kamala Harris" data-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2F0525560734%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dmarieclaireus-in-1382081949290157800-20" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2F0525560734%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yc7TghEBV63aL2v4kpjMmV-1920-80.jpg></p></a><p>'The Truths We Hold' by Kamala Harris</p><p>Ella then added: "I think when we met her, I was about to go into high school, so I was in an equally intense time, but for different, more angsty reasons. It felt serious when he was just talking about her, because I could hear it in his voice. When we did meet, it all felt so natural that it wasn't even a big deal. It felt like we had known each other forever. And I think what was important was getting to know her as a person first—a person before a politician.</p><p>"When Harris made the decision to run for president, she explained: "They are my endless source of love and pure joy...I can say one thing with certainty, my heart wouldn’t be whole, nor my life full, without them."</p><p>Obviously, their schedules (especially Harris') are crazy, but it's pretty clear they still try to make time for each other:</p><p>They used to gather every Sunday for family dinner.

"It feels completely unprecedented for us because we haven't really been around politics our entire life. We're still kind of getting used to it," Cole said.
