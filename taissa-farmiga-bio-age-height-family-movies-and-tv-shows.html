You don't have to psych yourself up for the scene. You can just go off what you were already feeling.</li><li>Communication feels like it should be the simplest thing, but it's not. Sometimes you don't even understand what you're feeling. You don't know how to put that into words, so how are you supposed to tell the person you love that you're upset.</li><li>Theratre is not like like in film and TV, where you have to stop and go back and keep redoing the same three pages for two hours. You get to go through the whole 80 pages of the script, which is incredible.</li><li>I have a rebellious teenage thing. If my mom says I can't do it, I'm gonna do it. But I'm pretty good. That's why it was fun to play Sam in<i> The Bling Ring.</i> I got to be someone crazy and wild to the extreme, then go home and relax and get rid of the burden.</li><li>One of the hardest things I've had to learn is to let it go at the end of the show or the end of the rehearsal day to just take a deep breath and say, "Alright, that was it. That was the day."</li><li>I'm a perfectionist, so it's hard for me to just accept that that I can't keep working until it's perfected. But I'm learning, I'm growing as a human in that way.</li><li>To be honest, I didn't have any expectations. I really didn't know what to expect. What I was most nervous about was the repetition of doing it over and over and over again. Does that get stale? How do you keep it fresh? Then I realized it's always new because you get to keep playing the next moment.</li><li>We all get frustrated and we all get angry, especially being young. We're happy so quickly, we're mad so quickly, and everything is just flowing so fast.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f1176e61598dbe88.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top details about Tanya Haden: Age, height, ethnicity, net worth, husband</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/11d27514ab1585f8.png><ul><li>I get scared easily, so I'm not one for just sitting down with a bowl of popcorn and watching horror stories. But, I mean, I'm learning more. Maybe one day I'd like to be able to watch them.</li><li>Sometimes I think too much, or sometimes I don't think enough as the character. Sometimes you just miss a moment, or sometimes you hear something that a character's saying that you haven't heard before and you react differently.</li><li>I don't have much to compare it to because I really didn't know much about theater. After I signed on, I started reading a lot of Sam Shepard plays just to brush up on my history and do some research. What's great is that Sam's been here and he's been in rehearsals with us. Sometimes you don't even notice him come in; he's just sitting there in the theater seats watching you.</li><li>When I was younger, I didn't have any aspirations to be an actress.</li><li>If you don't have a Facebook, like, you're nobody. There's all of these sorts of requirements now, and if you don't have all of these things - Facebook, Twitter, etc. - you're made fun of. And Twitter for celebrities... everything is just getting so personal. Pictures of yourself, of what you're eating for breakfast.</li><li>First off, I could never become a doctor. Blood? Even the fake blood on<i> 'American Horror Story,' </i>I'm kind of ready to hurl.</li><li>I was hoping, actually, that being on the other side of the camera in a scary movie, see how it's filmed and maybe you won't be as scared next time you watch one... didn't really work out! Because I know it's fake, but I just get so into it.</li><li>I do make a good ragu pasta, which everyone seems to like. Or that could be just me talking; who knows what they really think. I actually stole the recipe from my older sister Vera, who also loves to cook.
